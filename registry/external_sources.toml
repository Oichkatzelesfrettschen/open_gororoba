# C-071: FRB Ultrametric Structure -- Data Provenance

## Claim

C-071: "FRB dispersion measures exhibit p-adic ultrametric structure."

## Outcome

**Refuted** (2026-02-06). No ultrametric signal detected in either CHIME
Catalog 1 (600 events) or Catalog 2 (5045 events) across three DM columns
and eight statistical tests per column, with Bonferroni correction.

## DM Columns Used

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `bonsai_dm` | Real-time DM from CHIME/FRB's bonsai search pipeline |
| `dm_exc_ne2001` | Extragalactic DM excess (total DM minus NE2001 Milky Way contribution) |
| `dm_exc_ymw16` | Extragalactic DM excess (total DM minus YMW16 Milky Way contribution) |

NE2001 and YMW16 are two independent models of the Milky Way's electron
density distribution. Subtracting the Galactic contribution yields the
extragalactic DM, which is the physically relevant quantity for testing
cosmic ultrametric structure.

- **Results**: `data/csv/c071_frb_ultrametric.csv` (combined),
  `data/csv/c071_frb_ultrametric_cat1.csv`,
  `data/csv/c071_frb_ultrametric_cat2.csv`

## Test Battery (per DM column)

1. Euclidean ultrametric fraction (5% isosceles tolerance)
2. Graded ultrametric defect (permutation null)
3. P-adic clustering, p=2

Abstract: Building on two prior studies of zero-divisors (ZD's) generated by the Cayley-
Dickson process, algebras we call "lariats" (Line Algebras of Real and Imaginary Axis
Transforms), linkable to quantum measurement, are discovered in the Sedenions, com-
plementing the 7 isomorphic "box-kites" (pathway systems spanning octahedral lattices)
interconnecting all primitive ZD's. By switching "edge signs," products among the diago-
nal line-pairs associated with each of a box-kite's 4 triangular, vertex-joined, "sails" gen-
erate not 6-cyclic ZD couplings when circuited, but 28 pairs of structures with Quaterni-
onic multiplication tables - provided their symbols represent the oriented diagonals as
such, not point-specifiable "units" residing on them. If a box-kite's 3 "struts" (pairs of
opposite vertices, the only vertex pairings which do not contain mutual ZD's) each be
combined with the ZD-free Quaternion copy uniquely associated with said box-kite, 21
lariats with Octonionic multiplication, one per each box-kite strut pair, are generated.
Extending this approach to "emanation tables" (box-kite analogs in higher 2n-ions) indi-
cates further ZD-masking "sleeper cell" structures, with "renormalization"'s basis possib-
ly amenable to rethinking, thanks partly to the ZDs' newfound "Trip Sync" property,
inhering throughout the 2n-ion hierarchy.

 0. Zero-Divisors and Box-Kites Thus Far . . .
         It's been common knowledge since the 19th Century that, by use of a simple algo-
rithm dubbed the "Cayley-Dickson Process" (CDP), one can start with the real numbers,
then progressively double dimensions to yield, in sequence, the Imaginaries, Quaternions,
Octonions, Sedenions, and general 2n-ions. For almost as long, it's also been known that
each such doubling causes increased flexibility in some senses, but loss of crucial struc-
ture in others: order relations and uniqueness of powers break down with Imaginaries
(without whose angular power law, however, and remarkably simple relationship to ste-
reographic projection, modern mathematics and wave mechanics would be unthinkable);
Quaternions don't commute (thanks to which "failure," the vector-mechanical description
of real forces in the physical world is derivable); Octonions are non-associative (making
cause-effect relationships untraceable, but quark confinement and M-Theory's "brane
scan" thinkable). Beyond these 8-D imaginaries, though, Hurwitz showed a century ago
(see Kantor and Solodovnikov) that the very notions of "field" and a metrical "norm" fall
apart, thanks to the appearance of a new kind of "monster": the zero-divisor.
         Non-zero numbers whose product is zero at first seemed pathological, but are now
- thanks to quantum mechanical "projection operators" and their formal link to "observa-
bles" - quite acceptable in "mixed" company. That is, if one defines a space with not just
reals and imaginaries, but Pauli-spin-matrix-based "mirror numbers" too, whose non-real
units square to +1, then the Clifford Algebras which allow them all to intercommunicate
necessarily contain zero divisors. These, however, are of a special sort: if the "mirror
number" unit be written as "e," then the two quantities <U+00BD> (1 <U+00B1> e) are not just idempotents
(hence algebraic analogs of "1"'s among Reals) on two orthogonal axes in a 4-D "bicom-
plex" space; more, they have zero for their product - which product obtains for any pair
of points taken one from each axis. (As we'll see, the association of the zero-divisor pro-
perty with lines of numbers, not just points, has quite far-reaching consequences.)
         In "hypercomplex" spaces spanned only by the real axis plus lines whose units
square to -1, however, the emergence of zero divisors is more problematic, and long re-
mained poorly understood. In the 16-D Sedenions, the first extension of the imaginaries
where they announce themselves, it took until 1998 before Guillermo Moreno showed a
homomorphism between zero-divisor structure and the automorphism group of the Octo-
nions, whose Coxeter-Dynkin diagram is known in the argot of the "A, D, E" classifica-
tion as "G2" - and not just in the Sedenions, but in all higher 2n-ions (since G2 is also the
"derivation algebra" upon whose backbone all higher CDP imaginaries articulate them-
selves). But: homo- is not iso-, and concrete methods for extracting and studying zero-
divisors were still lacking . . . until the Fall of 2000.
         In the first paper in this series, a remarkably simple method was demonstrated for
generating, and studying the interconnections among, all Sedenion zero-divisors. By em-
ploying (among the literally hundreds of billions of options) a scheme for labeling the 15
imaginary axes based strictly on XOR calculations (the index of iA times iB will always be
A xor B), and conforming to CDP-generated signing patterns, zero divisors were shown
to fill 84 diagonal lines, spanning 42 planes dubbed "Assessors," the axes of the latter be-
ing simply derived as follows: pick any arbitrary Octonion 'o' (index 1-7, for 7 choices),
and any pure Sedenion 'S' whose index is greater than 8 and not equal to the XOR of 'o'
with 8 (for 6 choices); then all points on the orthogonal diagonals o <U+00B1> S will be zero-divi-
sors, but never with points on each other. Rather, diagonals from different Assessors will
mutually zero-divide each other, according to easy-to-visualize path-selection rules.
          The visualizing strategy was based on placing labels for each of the 42 Assessors
on exactly 1 of the 6 vertices of 1 of 7 isomorphic octahedral lattices (the "Box-Kites"),
then taking products of points along one or the other diagonal associated with each neigh-
boring vertex, according to an "edge-signing"protocol. If the sign along the edge adjoin-
ing 2 vertices is "+," this indicates the product of similarly oriented diagonals (both either
o + S or o - S: hence, "/<U+00B7> /" or "\<U+00B7> \"); if the sign is "-," then only pairings of oppositely
oriented diagonals ("/ <U+00B7> \" or "\ <U+00B7> /") will mutually zero-divide. But how allocate the edge-
signs? And, even more fundamentally, how partition the 42 Assessors among the 7 Box-
Kites? Upon answering the second, we will see the first question almost answers itself.
         We state without proof the Strut Constant Rule: each of the 7 ways of excluding 1
of the 7 Octonions, whose index we'll call the "strut constant," s, results in a set of 6
which can be mapped directly to 6 vertices of precisely one Box-Kite; moreover, the
index of the Sedenion making an Assessor with each, is the XOR of the given Octonion
with the "excess" X = 8 + s. Designate each Box-Kite with the Roman numeral of its
strut constant. Box-Kite I thus has these 6 Assessor index-pairs at its vertices: (2 <U+00B1> 11),
(3 <U+00B1> 10), (4 <U+00B1> 13), (5 <U+00B1> 12), (6 <U+00B1> 15), (7 <U+00B1> 14). (That is, 2 xor 11 = 3 xor 10 = 4 xor 13 =
5 xor 12 = 6 xor 15 = 7 xor 14 = X = 8+1 = 9.) These 6 are further partitioned into mutu-
ally non-zero-dividing pairs (the struts): those 3 couplings whose Octonions' XOR would
yield the missing strut-constant-indexed Octonion. With s = 1, the Assessor pairs with
Octonions indexed respectively by 2 and 3, 4 and 5, and 7 and 6, would sit at opposite
ends of diagonals (each playing that role for 2 orthogonal squares) on the octahedral
lattice. We write 7 and 6 out of counting order, because that is their signing order in the
most common XOR-based indexing scheme: the 7 Octonion triplets ("O-trips"), each
forming a Quaternion copy with the reals, are listed, lowest index first, in left-right, then
cyclical sequence, so that each successive pair's product in an O-trip is positively signed:

         (1, 2, 3); (1, 4, 5); (1, 7, 6); (2, 4, 6); (2, 5, 7); (3, 4, 7); (3, 6, 5)

         The strut-pairings just considered, then, are written in cyclic order as (2, 3); (4, 5);
(7,6). The 3 terminal indices can always be rearranged to form an O-trip in ascending
signing order (ASO) per the above list: (3, 6, 5) for Box-Kite I. Use this fact to mutually
orient strut-pairs as follows: pick a triangle on the octahedron, label vertices A, B, C, and
place "-" signs on the edge-lines between them. Label vertices at opposite ends of their
struts F, E, D respectively, putting "-" signs on their triangle's edge-lines, and "+" signs
on the 6 remaining edges. For Box-Kite I, set (A, B, C) to (3, 6, 5), hence (4, 7, 2) to F,
E, D, in that order. O-trips now fill the vertices of 4 of the Box-Kite's 8 triangles, which
we call "Sails." These share no edges, touching only at vertices, separated checkerboard-
style by 4 "empty" triangles we call "Vents." The other Sails are (A, D, E), (F, D, B) and
(F, C, E), these 3 having only 1 "-" edge-sign each. (All such letter triplets represent in-
dices in signing order sequence - which, for Box-Kites I, II, III, are all "ASO" as well.)
         Multiplying Assessors in sequence around a Sail's vertices, according to the edge-
signing rule, a 6-cyclic listing of zero-divisor couplings results. Start with the (- -, ++)
diagonal at A; circuiting (A, B, C) in Box-Kite I yields this progression: (i3 + i10)(i6 - i15)
= (i6 - i15)(i5 + i12) = (i5 + i12)(i3 - i10) = (i3 - i10)(i6 + i15) = (i6 + i15)(i5 - i12) = (i5 - i12)(i3 + i10)
= 0. Observe, too, that in any Sail, each vertex's Octonion forms a Quaternionic axis-trio
with the other 2 vertices' Sedenions, all 21 such "S-trips" with no "8" in them appearing
only in such contexts, precisely once each among the 7 (A, B, C) Sails.
 1. Groups, Loops and Lariats
        For the reader's convenience, the 28 S-trips are listed in signing order below, fol-
lowed by a "Strut Table" which shows Box-Kite structures per the above specifications.
The only column in the table which will seem strange to those who haven't read the first
monograph in this series (henceforth, "BK1," with its successor shorthanded "BK2") is
the second: explaining what GoTo numbers are, though, will take us to our next topic,
where new material will begin to reveal itself.

                  (1, 8, 9)         (1, 11, 10)     (1, 13, 12)     (1, 14, 15)
                  (2, 8, 10)        (2, 9, 11)      (2, 14, 12)     (2, 15, 13)
                  (3, 8, 11)        (3, 10, 9)      (3, 15, 12)     (3, 13, 14)
                  (4, 8, 12)        (4, 9, 13)      (4, 10, 14)     (4, 11, 15)
                  (5, 8, 13)        (5, 12, 9)      (5, 10, 15)     (5, 14, 11)
                  (6, 8, 14)        (6, 15, 9)      (6, 12, 10)     (6, 11, 13)
                  (7, 8, 15)        (7, 9, 14)      (7, 13, 10)     (7, 12, 11)

        Note that the first column of S-trips contains the index-8 imaginary, and hence
none of these appear in any Box-Kite Sails. They do, however, play a central role, since
each contains precisely and only those indices forbidden from appearing in precisely 1
Box-Kite. In the first monograph, the offending index number's unique tagging of a
"tame" kind of Quaternionic 3-sphere, in conjunction with the well-known billiards-based
phrase for the unplayability of shots one is forced to take behind it, suggested calling such
a zero-divisor-bereft S-trip an "8-ball." When its actions are treated in conjunction with
those of its associated Box-Kite, we will see some surprises will be waiting for us. Be-
fore we get to those, though, here's the promised aid to Box-Kite building, followed with
an explanation of the "GoTo Numbers" column.

          In the listing of O-trips in ASO sequence given above, the 7 were put in ascending
order, as sorted by first digit, then second if necessary. The "GoTo numbers" refer to O-
trips by this indexing scheme, indicating thereby 7 "Octonion counterfeits" whose non-
real axes consist of the given O-trip plus the 4 Sedenions which aren't indexed by 8, the
strut constant, or the XOR of these two. For each Box-Kite, 4 such numbers are listed,
indicating in the order written the 4 "Octonion counterfeits" from which the 4 successive
Sails (which we now list with edge-signs inserted) derive. For Box-Kite I, "7, 6, 4, 5"
means the pattern of zero-divisors in A-B-C- is uniquely contained in the 7-dimensional
space spanned by imaginaries with indices 3, 6, 5 (ABC's O-trip), plus 9, 10, 12 and 15;
Sail A+D-E+ is embedded in the space whose axial indices are (3, 4, 7, 9, 10, 13, 14);
Sail F-D+B+ is linked to (2, 4, 6, 9, 11, 13, 15); and F+C+E-, to (2, 5, 7, 9, 11, 12, 14).
         In BK1, these 8-D algebras were called "automorphemes," with each Assessor
appearing in 2 of them. It was shown, as well, that they were not isomorphic to the Octo-
nions, as their O-trips' signing orders could never be made consistent with the "true"
Octonions, as deviations always appear in at least 2 O-trip sequences, no matter how one
transformed among labeling schemes. Raoul Cawagas has recently corroborated that all
the primitive Sedenion zero-divisors indeed inhere in such algebraic objects, which he
showed by his FINITAS algebraic software package correspond to a hitherto unidentified
kind of loop-theory entity, which he calls a "quasi-octonion loop," or <U+00D5>L, This has almost
the same properties as the standard Octonion NAFIL (for Non-Associative Finite Inverti-
ble Loop), the 16-element maximal subloop (+ and - values of each axial unit), short-
handed OL , of the Sedenions' 32-element loop. The signal difference between them is the
former's failure to satisfy the Moufang identity. More, the Sedenions possess 7 copies of
this non-Moufang loop, whose axis systems' imaginaries have indices identical to our
"automorpheme" listings.
         The Sedenions, as Cawagas showed, also possess 7 extra copies of the standard
Octonion loop, each constructed by taking one of the 7 O-trips, then supplementing it
with the 4 Sedenions whose indices are 8 and the XOR's of 8 with the O-trip. (Further
subloops correspond to the smaller, quite familiar groups: the 35 Quaternion copies (7
O-trips + 28 S-trips); 15 4-cycles associated with the imaginaries; the 2-cycle of the plus
and minus real units; and, the trivial 1-element additive group corresponding to 0.) Our
septet of "8-balls" clearly appear as subloops within these, each appearing in 3 (1 per
each O-trip containing its strut constant). This listing exhausts the groups and loops
housed in the Sedenions, but not all the interesting algebras. The largest of the latter also
have Octonion multiplication tables, with each 8-ball also appearing in 3 different ones;
but as we'll soon see, they are far from identical to the creatures we've just looked at!
          The new kind of algebra captures the breakdown of metric norms - and shows it
as distinct from (and, in fact, prior to) the emergence of zero-divisors. These "lariats" are
adjustable loops, hence metrically indeterminate, which helps explain their name; but
their designation is also an acronym, for Line Algebras of Real and Imaginary Axis
Transforms, with the stress on the first word: for the entities whose behaviors are tracked
in lariat multiplication tables are oriented lines comprising numerical axes, not length-
fixed "units"residing at specifiable locations on same. The "stretchy" nature of zero divi-
sor pairings, where the choice of points to multiply taken from each is arbitrary, is thereby
captured . . . but without the zero-division property itself becoming manifest. Lariats,
then, are like "sleeper cells": the zero-dividing "terrorism potential" of some of their ele-
ments may only become apparent when contexts shift, with no warnings given.
 2. 8-Ball + Box-Kite = Switching Yard
         It is a staple of silent-movie melodramas like "Perils of Pauline": the heroine is
tied to the railroad tracks by a moustachioed villain in black; the hero arrives almost too
late, but saves the day by throwing his weight against a large switching-yard lever arm
which moves the rails (and thereby redirects the rushing train) just in the nick of time.
         After contemplating the simplicity and structural richness of Box-Kites, it is hard
to believe it had been assumed for a century that divisors of zero were pathological enti-
ties with nothing recommending their study. But now we've seen them, a child-like ques-
tion arises: what happens if you change the edge-signs and multiply the "wrong" line ele-
ments together? If (i3 + i10)(i6 - i15) = 0, what about (i3 + i10)(i6 + i15)? And what system of
relations, if any, obtains between such "switched" products and our octahedral lattice?
         As part of the answer, switch all the "-" signs to "+" in Box-Kite I's ABC Sail:
we now orbit the vertices in near-group-theory style, in a 3-cycle, two per sail. Whether
we pick the "/" diagonal as in the last paragraph, or the "\", as long as we're consistent, it
doesn't matter: kA <U+00B7> kB = 2k2 <U+00B7> C, kB <U+00B7> kC = 2k2 <U+00B7> A, kC <U+00B7> kA = 2k2 <U+00B7> B. Hence, if we set k
= <U+00BD>, we almost have a group: <U+00BD> (i3 + i10) <U+00B7> <U+00BD> (i6 + i15) = <U+00BD> (i5 + i12). The would-be group,
though, is non-commutative, as signs on products flip when term orders reverse. But we
don't have even a non-Abelian group, since recalibrating per above gives us A2 = B2 = C2
= - <U+00BD> , which is clearly only half of what we need to get a Quaternion "working copy"!
         To add to the confusion, picking proper "units" on such zero-divisor axes, so as to
create isomorphs of the complex plane, requires a different calibration: the radius of the
circle in the Argand diagram requires k be set not to <U+00BD>, but the square root of <U+00BD>! This
of course makes the case for reading a sign-switched "Sail"as a Quaternion copy even
worse, since the 3 non-real axes can no longer be subgroups without being "tuned."
         This is the motivation for the lariat construct: for if all calibrations be ignored,
and only the placement and orientation of diagonal line elements be considered, we see
that each Sail consists of 2 Quaternion-like lariats, with the caveat that instead of the real
unit serving as identity, the (positively oriented) real axis as a whole does (call it a life-
line). This is readily shown true for all "sign-switched" Sails: the other 3 now have 2 "-"
and 1 "+" edge-signs, but otherwise yield 2 sets of "Quizzical Quaternions" each.
         Corresponding to William Rowan Hamilton's famous formula, we can write 2
"ijk"-style one-liners to capture this behavior for each Sail. Call the axis of reals "R,"
and use upper and lower case letters to stand for the (- -, ++) or "/" and (- +, + -) or "\"
diagonals respectively: "A" now means (i3 + i10), while "a" stands for (i3 - i10). Show the
switched edge-signs between the Sail's vertices, and here's what we get:

                        A+B+C+:         A2 = B2 = C2 = ABC = (- R)
                                        a2 = b2 = c2 = abc = (- R)

                        A-D+E-:         A2 = d2 = e2 = Ade = (- R)
                                        a2 = D2 = E2 = aDE = (- R)

                        F-C-E+:         F2 = c2 = E2 = FcE = (- R)
                                        f2 = C2 = e2 = fCe = (- R)

                        F+D-B-:         F2 = D2 = b2 = FDb = (- R)
                                        f2 = d2 = B2 = fdB = (- R)
          It is curious to relate the "/" and "\" flips in the list just given to the correlated or-
dering of S-trip signings in each case. As mentioned at the end of the introductory sec-
tion, each pair of Octonions in each Sail's O-trip can be replaced with their associated
Sedenions, yielding an S-trip which circuits the same 3 Assessors. Only with ABC, how-
ever, whose edge-signs are all "-," are orientations maintained consistently: e.g., (3, 6, 5);
(3, 15, 12); (10, 6, 12); ( 10, 15, 5) all cycle in left-right order. With the other Sails, 2
orientations are always reversed, with only the S-trip whose Octonion is shared with ABC
displaying the same cycle order as its own O-trip. Striking enough to merit a name, as the
"Trip-Sync Property," this fact should prove quite powerful in future simulation studies
of emergent order, and "firefly tree"-type synchronization, especially among ensembles of
Box-Kite-guided waves or particles - a theme we'll touch upon from other angles later
on. For now, though, we return to lariats, to see what others the Sedenions might house.
         If we include an 8-Ball with its proper Box-Kite, we find that the two diagonals at
each end of a strut combine with the 8-Ball's "true copy" of the Quaternions, producing a
lariat of "Mock Octonions." This is demonstrable by direct calculation, provided we set
up good notation. Use "R" and upper vs. lower casing as per above; make "8" stand for
the unit with that index, and "S" for the unit indexed by the strut constant; then, write "X"
for the unit whose index is the "XOR" of 8 with the strut constant. If we next pick A and
F as our strut pair, we can build a "Mock Octonion" multiplication table as follows:
writing our symbols in the sequence (R, 8, X, S; F, a, f, A), we get the same table as if
we'd associated these with the standard reals, and imaginaries indexed 1 - 7, respectively.
         The same occurs if we substitute the other two struts: instead of "F, a, f, A" em-
ploy "E, b, e B" or "D, c, d, C" to the same effect . . .which means each pairing of Box-
Kite with 8-Ball yields 3 isomorphic "Mock Octonion" lariats, as claimed earlier, for 21
in all. (As opposed to 2 x 4 x 7 = 56 "Quizzical Quaternion" lariats.) Here's the table:

                 Generic Multiplication Table for "Mock Octonion" Lariats

         The 8-Ball's Quaternion group is highlighted in the upper left quadrant; F and A
stand in for the indices of the strut-pair represented by those letters on a given Box-Kite
lattice. An isomorphic table results if E and B (and e and b), or D and C (and d and c),
are substituted for F and A (and f and a) respectively. As with the Quizzicals, upper case,
for a given Assessor, indicates the (o + S) or "/" diagonal; lower case, the (o - S) or "\".

         Putting together the Box-Kite and 8-Ball associated with same strut constant, we
get 1 of 7 isomorphic, 16-dimensional, "Switching Yards": the table given above can be
used to instantiate them all, per the substitution rules given in the text. The 8-Ball "true
Quaternion" subtable is shaded upper-left, and is contained in all 3 Mock Octonion lariats
associated with a given strut constant. For easy parsing, the remaining <U+00BE> of each such
lariat are similarly color-coded. The zeros associated with the product-pairings along a
Box-Kite's 12 edge-signs take up 48 of the table's 256 cells, and are painted pale yellow.
(The simple task of eking out the octet of Quizzicals' identity-element-less "ijk-tables"
from the remaining 8 x 6 white cells is left as an exercise for the curious.)
         In the above, zero-divisors have been sufficiently "tamed" to make contemplating
their uses where most needed - in quantum theory. Some hints to this effect have been
dropped in what's already been said. In the pages that remain, we'll pursue these further,
plus other oddments which haven't been broached yet. It is implicit that "lariats" suggest
a rather deeper answer to how Uncertainty works than just passing the buck to "probabili-
ty waves"; for such an ascription to make sense, the vice of the "N Squares Rule" break-
down - shown long ago by Cayley's friend Kirkman to create a never-ending passalong
to higher 2n-ions, if the product space Sedenions implicate is to be closed - must be
turned into a virtue: which suggests some rethinking of what "renormalization" means,
and why it is called for in the first place. And then there are some other things . . .
 3. Switching-Yard Exotica: "Trigram Currents" and the "DJ Play-List Problem"
         Say "+" on an edge-sign is seen as green, while "-" appears as red. If we "throw
the switch" on all edge-signs at once, Sail ABC and Vent DEF reverse colors. But if we
are viewing the square formed by any 2 struts from atop the third, changing "+" to "-"
would appear like a 90<U+00BA> rotation (along all 3 struts simultaneously, in fact). What were
called "tray-racks" in this series' first installment are the 4-cycles of zero-producing pro-
ducts we get when traversing the edges of any of the Box-Kite's 3 squares: B-C+E-D+;
A-C+F-E+; A+D-F+C-. Toggling signs shifts sequences, but doesn't change them.
         On the first effect, it's easy to see we get a 3-bit code uniquely telling us which
Sail, in which switch-state, we're looking at. The patterns we get, in fact, are precisely
those of the "coin oracle" method of creating I Ching readings. With 3 heads, or 2 tails
and 1 head, we get a "yang" line: ABC, FDB, ADE, FCE give + + +, + - -, - + -, - - +,
respectively, meaning we're in the land of "lariats," where products conceivably yield up
indeterminate "measurement quanta" as allowed by Quaternionic or Octonionic represen-
tation schemes. But 3 tails, or 2 heads and 1 tail, yield a "yin" line instead: the "zero-
division" condition, with the 4 Sails now bit-mapped to - - - , - + +, + - +, + + - .
         If we then map "- " to 0, and "+" to 1, we get the 3-bit code, and then can start
wondering about what sort of "breathing" would govern such yin-yang yoyo-ing. (And
just as crucial would be grasping - perhaps via simulation studies of the "cellular automa-
ton" variety - how 2 or more Box-Kite "particles" might interact, or which "hexagrams"
might result from their exchanges under different conditions.) Given that the second pa-
per in this series showed how the analogs of Box-Kites in higher 2n-ions can be decom-
posed or "folded" into the simpler forms found in the Sedenions, the study of such "tri-
gram currents" might prove quite illuminating.
          But now let's take a look at the second effect mentioned above: the "rotation" of
tray-racks A-C+F-E+, A+D-F+C-, B-C+E-D+. Unlike the 2 types of 6-cycles (one, for
A- B- C- only, called a "triple zigzag" due to its "/ \ / \ / \" alternation pattern; the other,
obtaining for the other 3 Sails, dubbed a "trefoil" after the same-named knot), the alter-
nating signs bring a tray-rack circuit back to the diagonal it started with in just 4 steps, so
that 2 such circuits of the same quartet of Assessors (1 starting with a "/"diagonal, the
other with a "\") are required to "cover all the bases."
         But if we "throw the switch" to get lariats instead of zero-division sequencing,
each tray-rack circuit generates 2 of the 4 terms comprising the 3rd strut orthogonal to its
plane in the Box-Kite octahedron - suggesting the cross-product familiar in vector calcu-
lus, but also having a unique higher-dimensional analog in the Octonions, which product
is preserved in the Octonions' automorphism group, G2 - which, since Moreno's work, we
know governs zero-divisor structure, too, in the Sedenions as well as all higher 2n-ions.
         Geoffrey Dixon has further shown how varieties of Octonion vector products can
generate the Barnes-Wall and Leech lattices in 16- and 24- D, respectively. These not
only play critical roles in "closest sphere-packing" and self-correcting error-code theories,
but in M-Theory (the 16-D "4,320-packing" being the basis of the O(32) string). Even
more compelling, Dominic Joyce's holonomy manifold with G2 symmetry is currently
seen as the most likely candidate for harboring the 7 "curled-up" gauge-dimensions of M-
Theory. Making this seem even less a coincidence, the G2 Joyce manifold is generated by
a system of 7 x 7 equations which readily reduce to 35: viz., 7 O-trips, linked 1-to-1 with
the 7 "8-Balls," with the triple-zigzag's substitution symmetry linking each such pairing
uniquely to 3 S-trips, for 5 x 7 = 35 Quaternion copies in all, 1 per each Joyce generator?
          To replace the "?" with a "." in that last sentence, we need to investigate what
might be termed the "Dixon-Joyce circulatory system": we know we can get from the G2
manifold to the Barnes-Wall lattice, hence M-Theory. We can imagine 35 equations each
tracking one of the 35 Quaternion copies in the Sedenions. Which raises the "DJ Play-
List Problem": how do we get from the "play list" of Barnes-Wall circuits Dixon's Octo-
nion vector-products give us, to Sedenion orbits, and thence back down to Joyce's 35
choices? In the 8-D space of Octonions, there is an exact correspondence between the
240 "closest-packed" hyperspheres there and Octonion arithmetic, as Coxeter's classic
study of "Integral Cayley numbers" made clear. But the link between closest-packing and
number theory breaks down in higher dimensions; there are many different systems for
navigating 16-D spaces, whose interrelationships are hardly as well-mapped as those in
spaces of 8 dimensions or less.
         The other 16-D-lattice-based string theory, "E8 x E8," is shown in M-Theory to be
transformable into O(32), the latter comprising the objects at distance 2 on the same lat-
tice whose unit-distance objects yield the famous anomaly-free "496" of the former: E8
is just the "A, D, E Classification" code corresponding to the Cayley numbers, and twice
240 + 16-D Cartan subalgebra yields the "magic number." And this setup does have an
easily identified (if not so well-known) hypernumber equivalence: to the so-called "M-
algebra" posited by Charles Mus<U+00E8>s a quarter century ago. Just as the 4-space of reals plus
Pauli spin-matrices is isomorphic to the Quaternions, Mus<U+00E8>s made use of the 2 x 2 iden-
tity matrix, with the usual imaginaries replacing the "1's," to commute between the 2
spaces (in effect, building the Clifford algebra Cl3), then used the matrix to commute be-
tween the Octonions and an "extended Pauli" 8-space, which 2 spaces (by the same argu-
ment used in 4-D) are isomorphic. Their total 16-D arithmetic, then, "spans" E8 x E8 -
albeit not as "nicely" as Octonions relate to integral Cayley numbers. What is of signal
interest, however, is the fact that, real axis aside, the Sedenions are pure imaginaries, but
Mus<U+00E8>s's M-algebra is a projection-operator-rich "half and half." Yet M-Theory transforms
between the O(32) and E8 x E8 string theories. What clean transformations exist between
Sedenion and "Switching Yard" arithmetics, and both Joyce and Dixon's domains?
         One more 16-D space in need of interrelating arises when the icosahedral reflec-
tion group ("H3" in "A, D, E" argot) is studied in singularity theory: members of Ar-
nol'd's school showed a correspondence to a 16-D manifold with a 4-D boundary singu-
larity - this latter so-called "open swallowtail" being a symplectic manifold in its own
right . . . and first instance of an infinite family of symplectic invariants, per the Givental'
theory of "triads." The link between symplectic and Quaternionic being self-evident, and
the fact that Moreno's paper showed a 4-D "boundary" in Sedenion space, in the sense of
"free of zero-divisors" (i.e., isomorphic to an "8-Ball"), one is led to wonder if there is
some connection here - and if so, whether Gabrielov's triads relate, in turn, to the infinite
sequence of 2n-ions (and hence, to some deep link between G2 and H3 in this context).
         All of which suggests that the "pathology" of zero-divisors, far from marking the
end in the road of useful extensions of the imaginary domain, may well mark the start of a
new journey, to hitherto unvisited places. And, as lariats and whatever other "sleeper
cell" structures hiding in higher dimensions can smuggle disguised zero-divisors into
much lower-dimensioned algebras than suspected (with implications we can only begin to
imagine for quantum foundations), so too we must allow for the possibility that much of
what passed for Nature's architecture in 20th Century physics may prove to be removable
scaffolding.
 4. Post-Script on the "Trip-Sync Property," and Mathematical Beauty
         Lab data displaying evidence of Chaos was, prior to that theory's emergence, typi-
cally tossed in the trash as so much "experimental error." Higher imaginaries containing
zero divisors have likewise been dismissed, with the sort of superficial ugliness easily
observed in the distribution of "Strut Table" S-trips - nicely mapped one per slot in ABC,
it's true, but with 2 or 3 occurences of the same S-trip, with compensating absences of
others, in the other 3 Sails - taken as endemic. But we've seen we can even contemplate
a bonafide representation theory for zero divisors thanks to lariats, and find an astonish-
ing degree of orderliness among S-trips thanks to the "Trip-Sync" property - the very
property which underwrites the emergence of Sedenion zero-divisors in the first place.
Beauty is not just in the mind of the beholder; it inheres in objective structures - but will
only be perceived by those who open themselves to it without prejudice. Readers are
invited to confirm the tabulation below with the evidence provided in the earlier listings
of O-trips and S-trips, the better to rid themselves of any such aesthetic impediments.

         "Trip-Sync" is not some "nice" feature obtaining in the Sedenions only. On the
contrary, it seems to be a fundamental property of Box-Kites at whatever level, as one can
readily verify in the 32-D world of the Pathions. The signal distinction between this are-
na and the 16-D Sedenions' is that the "emanation tables" therein - multiplication tables
involving 2n-1 - 2 entities, with one 2n-ion (whose index s < 2n-1 is the strut constant) ex-
cluded from each - interconnect multiple Box-Kites, defined in the Pathions by 4-, not 3-
bit, XORing. But for s <U+2264> 8, each such 14-vertex entity decomposes into 7 Box-Kites, all
showing "Trip-Sync" behavior. Take the O-trip associated with the ABC "triple-zigzag"
in the Sedenion Box-Kite for the same s, then add '8' to the associated Sedenion in each
Assessor to get the analogous Pathion. Using this Box-Kite as base-line, get the rest by
successively keeping one strut-pair unchanged, but substituting for the other 2 pairs, in 1
of the 2 ways the 8 "extra" Assessors allow. For s = 1, the 14 Pathion Assessors' S and P
indices (as opposed to Sedenions' o <U+00B1> S) all have "inner XOR" of 16 + 1 = 17, as follows:

 2,19 4,21 6,23 8,25 10,27 12,29 14,31 15,30 13,28 11,26 9,24 7,22 5,20 3,18

         By the same "nested parentheses" logic used with Sedenions, successive pairings
of outermost terms form struts, from (2, 19) and (3, 18) to (14, 31) and (15, 30). (See p.
14 of BK2 to find edge-signs given for the full "emanation table.") The 7 Box-Kites can
be put in a table analogous to the "Strut Table" provided above - but, s being the same
for all, sequencing results from holding each of the 3 struts constant, while replacing the
others in both ways that let ABC be an ASO S-trip, all 7 listed in ABC order:

                               A       B       C       D       E       F
Base-Line Box-Kite:            3       6       5       4       7       2
AF kept constant:              3      10       9       8      11       2
                               3      13      14      15      12       2
CD kept (& moved to AF):       5      12       9       8      13       4
                               5      14      11      10      15       4
BE kept (& moved to AF):       6      11      13      12      10       7
                               6      15        9      8      14       7

         Use the P-trip lists in BK2 to confirm. When s = 8, the logic given fails, since no
O-trip with an '8' can underwrite Sedenion ZD's. Here, however, what happens instead
is that one still gets 7 Box-Kites, but the ABC Sail in each is uniquely associated with
one of the 7 O-trips. For higher s, carry-bit "elbow room" runs out and "sand mandalas"
with only 3 Box-Kites result (see BK2), all 3 sharing strut (s - 8, 8). (Hence, using the 7
Sedenion Box-Kites as our "starter kit," we build 8 x 7 = 56, plus 7 x 3 = 21, for 84
Pathion Box-Kites all told: 1 per each Sedenion 8-Ball, Quizzical Quaternion and Mock
Octonion lariat, and ZD diagonal, respectively.) For s = 9, for instance, we get this trio:

                                  A      B       C       D       E        F
Base-Line Box-Kite:            (2, 27) (8, 17) (10,19) (3, 26) (1, 24) (11, 18)
"First Harmonic":              (4, 29) (8, 17) (12,21) (5, 28) (1, 24) (13, 20)
"Second Harmonic":             (7, 30) (8, 17) (15,22) (6, 31) (1, 24) (14, 23)

       Trip-Sync holds here too. Prove, qualify, or refute: it holds for all 2n-ions, n > 3.

## Key Contributions

### 1. Spandrels (Hidden Box-Kites)

*Spandrels* are quartets of ZD-free or "hidden" box-kite-like structures
(HBKs) in the 2^{N+1}-ions that are "exploded" from (and uniquely linked to)
each standard box-kite in the 2^N-ions, for N >= 4.

Any HBK houses, in a "cowbird's nest," exactly one copy of the (ZD-free)
octonions -- the recursive basis for all ZD ensembles.

### 2. Three Production Rules (Formalized)

**Production Rule 1 (Emanation):** If diagonals at assessors A and B mutually
zero-divide, each also does so with a diagonal of C (oppositely signed copies
of whose unit pairings embody the zero produced). A and B *emanate* C.
L-indices (a, b, c) form a trip iff their assessors' diagonals each mutually
zero-divide one of those at each of the other two.

A *sail* is a triad of assessors forming such a trip. There is exactly one sail
per box-kite with all three edges marked "-": the *zigzag* (A, B, C). Its
6-cycle of zero-divisions shows alternating / and \ slopings.

**Production Rule 2 (Catamaran twist):** L- (or U-) indices can be swapped
(with a sign flip) between assessors sharing an edge, yielding assessor pairs
in other box-kites with different strut constants. Opposite edges of the same
square (one of 3 mutually orthogonal ones) twist to the same box-kite and
have the same sign type.

**Production Rule 3 (Assessor membership):** Any assessor belongs to exactly
2 sails, like same-color checkerboard squares touching only at vertices. The
pair of imaginary units forming any assessor always splits so that one has
index less than G (L-unit) and one greater than G (U-unit).

### 3. Catamaran Twist Structure

Box-kites have three mutually orthogonal "squares" (catamarans) formed by
strut pairs. Each catamaran has 4 edges connecting its 4 assessors. Opposite
edges twist to the same other box-kite and share edge-sign type.

### 4. G_2 Homomorphism

The automorphism group of the ZDs in 2^N-ions (for N >= 4) is
G_2 x (N-3) x S3, where G_2 is the smallest exceptional Lie group (the
Octonion automorphism group). The order for sedenions: 14 x 1 x 6 = 84
(the count of ZD-saturated lines across all 7 box-kites).

### 5. Trip Count and ZD Census

| Dim  | Name     | Trips | Notes                                   |
|------|----------|-------|-----------------------------------------|
| 4    | H        | 1     | No ZDs                                  |
| 8    | O        | 7     | No ZDs (but associativity fails)        |
| 16   | S        | 35    | 84 ZD-lines in 7 box-kites             |
| 32   | P        | 155   | 588 ZD-lines, scale-free behavior       |
| 64   | X        | 651   | "Fractality" of ZD structure evident    |

### 6. Scale-Free Network Connection

The ZD web in higher 2^n-ions displays the "scale-free" property characteristic
of real-world networks (WWW, social, biological). This suggests using ZD
ensembles as enriched network-theory nodules for modeling semantic propagation.

The strut constant for each box-kite is listed in the first cell of each row.
The Octonion indices of vertices A, B, C are in bold-face (forming the zigzag).
Their Assessor index-pairs are listed in columns A-F.

The "inner XOR" of the Octonion and Sedenion pairs defining the Assessors at
each box-kite vertex will always equal 8 + strut_constant.

| Strut | A     | B     | C     | D     | E     | F     |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| 1     | 3, 10 | 6, 15 | 5, 12 | 4, 13 | 7, 14 | 2, 11 |
| 2     | 1, 11 | 7, 13 | 6, 12 | 4, 14 | 5, 15 | 3,  9 |
| 3     | 2,  9 | 5, 14 | 7, 12 | 4, 15 | 6, 13 | 1, 10 |
| 4     | 1, 13 | 2, 14 | 3, 15 | 7, 11 | 6, 10 | 5,  9 |
| 5     | 2, 15 | 4,  9 | 6, 11 | 3, 14 | 1, 12 | 7, 10 |
| 6     | 3, 13 | 4, 10 | 7,  9 | 1, 15 | 2, 12 | 5, 11 |
| 7     | 1, 14 | 4, 11 | 5, 10 | 2, 13 | 3, 12 | 6,  9 |

**Properties:**
- Vertices A, B, C form the zigzag (all-minus-sign sail).
- Their L-indices (the octonion part, listed first) form a NATO triplet.
- The strut pairs are (A, F), (B, E), (C, D) -- strut-opposites never form DMZs.
- Each box-kite excludes exactly one octonion index (1-7), the strut constant.

### 3. Pathion (32D) Structure

- Pathions have 15 x 7 = 105 "16-less" triplets of form (O, S, P')
  yielding 210 Assessors in 15 ensembles (sand mandalas).
- In addition, 42 of the (P, P') pairings are ZDs, giving 504 "irreducible" ZDs
  specific to Pathions. With 84 from Sedenions, total is **588** = 3.5x Moreno's count.
- Each sand mandala has 14 Assessors, all sharing the same inner XOR.
- They house 168 fillable cells each (= |PSL(2,7)|).

### 4. Kite-Chain Middens

- Box-kite "harmonics" extend indefinitely into higher 2^n-ions.
- For Sedenion box-kites, harmonics are obtained by adding 16n to assessor indices.
- Two "Assessor harmonics" with indices (o + 16n, S + 16n) and
  (o' + 16n, S' + 16n) will emanate some (o xor o' = S xor S') in the base box-kite.
- The first harmonic (Pathions only) gives 2x the ZD-diagonals of a base box-kite.

### 5. Emanation Tables

- 15 spreadsheet-like layouts (14 x 14) for the Pathion sand mandalas.
- Cell (row, col) = O or S index of the ZD "emanated" by multiplying row-head's
  Assessor times column-head's Assessor, with appropriate edge-sign prefix.
- Both long diagonals are always empty (self-products and strut-opposites).
- Remaining 14^2 - 2*14 = 168 cells fillable.
- For strut constants > 8: only 72 of 168 cells contain emanations.
- For strut constant = 8: "edge polarization" -- peculiar alignment of edge-signs
  by quadrant (all same in upper-left and lower-right, all opposite elsewhere).

### 6. Sand Mandala Patterns (Page 15)

The seven 72-entry tables (with strut constants > 8) display patterns
reminiscent of cellular automata when viewed in sequence. When folded
along row/column midlines, they overlay precisely the vertices of the
Box-Kite whose strut constant equals the "excess" (strut_constant - 8).

### 7. Sedenion Multiplication Table (Page 12)

The 16x16 multiplication table for sedenion basis elements (indices 0-15)
is provided, using a checkerboard shading scheme. Below it, the complete
listing of 155 NATO triplets for the Pathions is given.

### 8. Curvature Tensor Connection (Page 6)

De Marrais notes the box-kite diagram is structurally identical to Milnor's
visualization (from Morse Theory) of the four symmetries of the Riemann
curvature tensor:
1. Skew-symmetry: R(X,Y)Z + R(Y,X)Z = 0
2. Cyclic sum: R(X,Y)Z + R(Y,Z)X + R(Z,X)Y = 0
3. Bracket skew-symmetry: <R(X,Y)Z,W> + <R(X,Y)W,Z> = 0
4. Inner/outer exchange: <R(X,Y)Z,W> = <R(Z,W)X,Y>

Abstract. G. Moreno's abstract depiction of the Sedenions' normed zero-divisors as homomorphic to the
exceptional Lie group G2, is fleshed out by exploring further structures the A-D-E approach of Lie alge-
braic taxonomy keeps hidden. A break-down of table equivalence among the half a trillion multiplication
schemes the Sedenions allow is found; the 168 elements of PSL(2,7), defining the finite projective triangle
on which the Octonions' 480 equivalent multiplication tables are frequently deployed, are shown to give the
exact count of primitive unit zero-divisors in the Sedenions. (Composite zero-divisors, comprising all
points of certain hyperplanes of up to 4 dimensions, are also determined.) The 168 are arranged in point-set
quartets along the 42 Assessors (pairs of diagonals in planes spanned by pure imaginaries, each of which
zero-divides only one such diagonal of any partner Assessor). These quartets are multiplicatively organized
in systems of mutually zero-dividing trios of Assessors, a D4-suggestive 28 in number, obeying the 6-cycle
crossover logic of trefoils or triple zigzags. 3 trefoils and 1 zigzag determine an octahedral vertex structure
we call a box-kite -- seven of which serve to partition Sedenion space. By sequential execution of proof-
driven production rules, a complete interconnected box-kite system, or Seinfeld production (German for
field of being; American for 1990's television's Show About Nothing), can be unfolded from an arbitrary
Octonion and any (save for two) of the Sedenions. Indications for extending the results to higher dimen-
sions and different dynamic contexts are given in the final pages.

 { 0 } Introduction: Some two centuries ago, de Moivre, Argand, Gauss, et al., determined that square

roots of negative unity could be domesticated (and rendered geometric) by the introduction of cyclical 2-D

numbers, ironically (given their futurity) deemed "imaginary." Since then, a succession of "period

doublings," to borrow the Chaos theorists' term, has produced ever more exotic numbers - but at the cost

of a loss of familiar behavior with each escalation. Already with the Imaginaries, the angular nature of the

exponent made a product's "winding number" indeterminate. With the doubling to 4-D effected by

Hamilton's Quaternions, three imaginary axes now could serve to map the composition of forces in the 3-D

space of mechanics, with the fourth axis of Reals relating to time or tension . . . but at the cost of

commutation. (Also lacking, of course, in the physical world such "vector mechanics" would model). The

redoubling to the 8-D Octonions of Cayley-Dickson algebra required surrendering associativity - and

swallowing the cause-effect indeterminacy such "parenthesis -placement uncertainty" implied. Hurwitz'

century-old proof, meanwhile, showed that further twofold "blow-ups" in dimension of the number system

would require the breakdown of the very notion of a division algebra: divisors of zero, for starters, would

be let in at the same door the distributive property would exit through.

         The development of quantum mechanics has made it clear that the benefits of such redoublings

have, on the whole, outweighed the costs. The semi-simple Lie-group taxonomizing associated with

Dynkin's (and, among geometers, Coxeter's) work has meanwhile allowed these developments to be tamed

in a benign set of ball-and-stick diagrams, associated with neutral-sounding letters and indices. The com-

plex numbers are A2, having the structure of 2-D closest packing patterns and the hexagonal arrays of

Eisenstein integers generated by the cube roots of the positive and negative units. The 24 integer Quater-

nions conform to the "Feynman checkerboard" pattern of D4; and - most spectacularly of all - the closest

packing of spheres in 8 dimensions, and the exceptional E8 related to icosahedral symmetry, correspond

precisely to the 240-element integer arithmetic Coxeter elicited for Octonions.

         Guillermo Moreno's recent (1997) discovery of the G2 homomorphism governing the zero

divisors in the 16-D Sedenions[1] would seem, on the surface, to be the latest triumph of this "A-D-E"

approach. And indeed, having conquered virtually all taxonomic work in all areas of mathematics where

finite typologies are pertinent, this is what we've come to expect. It's been only a quarter century since the

great Russian dynamicist Vladimir Arnol'd discovered that "A-D-E" could house much more than the



                                                      Page 2
 "particle zoos" of the physicists (and the complete catalog of Coxeter's kaleidoscopes). The classification

of singularities begun by Ren<U+00E9> Thom's Catastrophe Theory could be engulfed and extended by it, an

embarrassment of riches leading Arnol'd to speak of the "A-D-E Problem."[2] Today, there is likely no

item in the Coxeter-Dynkin "alphabet soup" that lacks a surprising realization as an unfoldable singularity

with boundaries or other constraints (or a projective-pencil "alcove" in Tits' theory of buildings, or a class

of quivers, light caustics, shock-waves or self-correcting error codes). Moreno's G2 would thereby seem to

be another indicator of what Arnol'd called the A-D-E-induced "mysterious unity of all things."[3]

         But Moreno discovered a homomorphism -- a "blow-up" of an exact correspondence - and the

"blow-ups" in the history of number theory have all entailed the loss of something. We know now that

among the numerous copies of the Octonions floating in the extra lebensraum of the Sedenion's 16-D, we

can find divisors of zero harbored among them according to G2 's 12-fold (or 14-fold, depending upon the

questions asked) logic. But how many such distinct sets of G2 's are there? Of what do these sets in fact

consist? What is the dynamic meaning of zero-division in their context?



{ I } Names, Notations, Conventions, Initial Constructions:

         As Moreno makes clear, a Sedenion zero divisor (unlike those in standard low-dimensioned Cliff-

ord algebras, typically generated by mutually annihilating idempotents with real components) is composed

of purely imaginary units. "Doubly pure," in his terminology, as he implicitly concerns himself only with

what will be called herein "primitive" zero-divisors, comprised of diagonals in planes spanned by pairs of

imaginary units. (We will see that additive sums of up to four such primitives also exist, and for such com-

posites it will no longer make much sense to focus, as Moreno does, on "normed unit" divisors: hyper-

planes of up to 4 dimensions will be found, all of whose points are zero-divisors, so that the infinity of

points on their unit spheres would all qualify for "normed unit" status.)

         The Sedenions' primitive zero-divisors will be referred to by a special name, "Assessors," and the

systems of these which mutually zero-divide each other (unlike the mutually annihilating pairs familiar

from Clifford algebra[4]) will be called "Co-Assessor trios." And while technically there are four "normed

unit" zero-divisors on the extended X that is an Assessor, in fact plus or minus differences along one or the

other diagonal have no effect on the basic dynamics. I prefer, therefore, to think of each Assessor's "X" as


                                                     Page 3
                        0
made of two infinite (S -normed) lines, one an orthographic slash, the other a backslash, all points of which

are zero-divisors with respect to one or the other such line of a Co-Assessor: '/' + '\' = 'X'. In the spirit of

the bit-twiddling to come, I call these paths "UNIX " and "DOS " respectively ("u" and "d" for short) after

the two dominating computer operating systems which differ in their bent for the one or the other.

         The name of the entity we're focused on herein is suggested by the "42 Assessors" of the Egyptian

Book of the Dead, who sit in two rows of 21 along opposite walls of the Hall of Judgement.[5] During the

soul's so-called "Negative Confession" (and our focus is almost solely on units which are roots of negative

unity), they ask embarrassing questions while the heart of the deceased is weighed in a pan-balance and

the soul-eating Devourer of the Unjustified watches. The three senses of Zero implicit in the italicized

words (and the need for two pans to achieve a balanced measurement), added to the coincidence of the

count, made the name seem an appropriate mnemonic.

         Our strategy, in some regards, is opposite Moreno's. He approaches things head on by attempting

to typify the non-standard or "special" features found in Sedenions that make zero-division possible. Here,

we'll be using everything we can that's nascent in associative triplets - be they pure Octonions ("O-trips"

henceforth) or inclusive of a pair of pure Sedenions ("S-trips") - as a sprinter would exploit a thrust-block.

Ditto for Moreno's results. Rather than concluding with a "G2 " existence proof, we begin with a dissatis -

fied need for a concrete revelation which the "G2 " finding has exacerbated.

         Recalling that zeros of equations are roots, and G2 root structure is an overlay of two hexa gonally

symmetric kaleidoscopes (a "doubled A 2 "), this means two distinct orbits of differing "root length." This

latter designation makes sense in the standard 3-D renderings of the 12 roots of the algebra found, for

instance, in Gilmore[6]. In the 8-D of an Octonion copy, the 6-cycle weaving between DOS and UNIX

paths of Asses sor triples, revealed by our first production rule, will provide the correspondence to the

classic A 2 image. Our second production rule will show how any Assessor pair can spawn another, in a

distinct A 2 -like orbit, by a skew-symmetric swap of their non-O-trip units. Thanks to the Cartan subalge-

bra, though, Lie algebraists think of G2 as 12 + 2 = 14-dimensional, displayed most blatantly in the fact of

the 7 O-trips, each equipped with a binary orientation (they're associative, but not commutative!).




                                                     Page 4
          To keep the tools clean, we'll refer not to "G2 " but GoTo listings of the 12 Co-Assessor matches

associated with each O-trip. Our third production rule, finally, will take us beyond local O-trip specifics to

links between Octonion copies in Sedenion space (each Assessor appears in exactly 2 of the 7 GoTo lists).

         We'll be short-handing zero-divisor pairs by use of their imaginary units' index numbers. Equa-

tions which would solve for these will be written as either (A, B) and (C, D) when signing doesn't matter,

or else as either (A + B) or (C - D), to indicate a pair of partially or completely unknown units whose path

of interest is UNIX or DOS respectively. (Hence, (- A - B) is UNIX, so (A + B) covers it, while (- C + D)

is covered by ( C - D ).) Often, we'll have recourse to the binary variable "sg" (which can only be +1)

operating, say, between a '+' or '-' and the right-hand letter within the parentheses.

         Most critically, we will indicate the product of two units A and B of unknown index like this: A

xor B. This leads to the all-important convention in choice of labeling the Sedenions: the index of the

product of two units must be the result of the XOR of the indices of the two units being multiplied. This

requires some (brief) commentary.

         The number of different ways one can label the Octonion units with suitable indices (480) is bad

enough; but Sedenions are even worse (half a trillion!). Different authors have different tastes, and mine

require products' indices be the XOR of the indices producing them. This is well-known to be possible, but

seldom exploited as a key feature (but see Michael Gibbs' pages giving "Bit Representations of Clifford

Algebras" posted on Tony Smith's web-site[7]). Without this simplifying constraint, in fact, none of the

many "bit-twiddling" proofs to follow would be possible! Hence, units indexed 7 and 12 should have

product with index (0111 XOR 1100 = 1011 =) 11.

         It's impossible to make signing completely consistent with cyclic ordering, so I'd rather solve for

than worry about it. I'm using the "canonical" Sedenion multiplication table, generated by unvarnished

Cayley-Dickson process, found on Tony Smith's web-site (derived, in turn, from Lohmus, Paal and Sorg-

sepp's book[8]). As will become clear toward the end, this is no mere convenience. Where zero divisors

are concerned, the assumed "equivalence" of the myriad multiplication tables allowed by the imaginary

units' permutations and signings (already not quite perfect with the Octonions, as recent work by Schray

and Manogue[9] has shown) breaks down. Whether this is "bug" or "feature," why it happens, and what to

do about it, are all questions that will concern us later, but for which final answers are not yet at hand.

            In the table, the real units are rendered as signed letter U's for purposes of this tabulating chore

only. This much said, here's my Sedenion table, which readers with excess time on their hands should feel

free to test for its XOR-worthiness:

Sedenions. These are the staff of life for all that follows, so let's stop to get acquainted with them.

           Let's short-hand associative triples as follows: if (ab)c = a(bc), take the index numbers of these

imaginary units and write them as a comma-delimited list in parentheses, in cyclical order. The lowest

index number comes first, then the index whose product with it yields the positive value of the third. The

Quaternions' "i, j, k" - almost always written as i1 , i2 , and i3 respectively - has its associative triplicity

indicated this way: (1, 2, 3). Using our Sedenion table, we can write the seven O-trips as follows:



          (1, 2, 3); (1, 4, 5); (1, 7, 6); (2, 4, 6); (2, 5, 7); (3, 4, 7); (3, 6, 5)



          It's visually obvious that only two of these triplets have counting order varying from cyclical

order: i1 x i6 = (-i7 ), and i3 x i5 = (-i6 ). (Of course, different triples are out of order in different notations.)

The other 28 associative triples in the Sedenions - the S-trips - are listed, per our table, next:



          (1, 8, 9)            (1, 11, 10)           (1, 13, 12)           (1, 14, 15)

          (2, 8, 10)           (2, 9, 11)            (2, 14, 12)           (2, 15, 13)

          (3, 8, 11)           (3, 10, 9)            (3, 15, 12)           (3, 13, 14)

          (4, 8, 12)           (4, 9, 13)            (4, 10, 14)           (4, 11, 15)

          (5, 8, 13)           (5, 12, 9)            (5, 10, 15)           (5, 14, 11)

          (6, 8, 14)           (6, 15, 9)            (6, 12, 10)           (6, 11, 13)

          (7, 8, 15)           (7, 9, 14)            (7, 13, 10)           (7, 12, 11)



          The leftmost diagram at the bottom of the next page is the "canonical" labeling of PSL(2,7) result-

ing from applying the Cayley-Dickson process. Each projective line contains 3 points (which determine

the "circle" of the Octonion 3-cycle indicated by the points' labels). The cycle in the middle (2, 4, 6) is the

only one actually appearing in this representation as a circle, although it is a "line" just like the other six.

This much is true for all representations employing the triangle. The differences concern labels and arrows

only: some authors also use an XOR representation, and so keep the labeling, but change the sign of a unit,

and so change the directions of the three arrows that pass through it. Or, they change multiple units' signs,

thereby switching some other count of arrows. (But always all or none, or 3 or 4, as we'll see later on).



                                                            Page 7
           The most frequently encountered variant (used by Schray and Manogue) switches the 6's sign,

and hence reverses the ( 1 7 6 ), ( 3 6 5), ( 2 4 6 ) triplets' cycling direction, replacing them, per our earlier

convention, with ( 1 6 7), ( 3 5 6 ), and ( 2 6 4 ) respectively. This shift can be represented by simply

flipping the bottom, vertical, and circular arrows; or (as Schray and Manogue do), by rotating the two lines

that pass from 1 through 6 and 5, which thereby also reverses the arrows on the diagonals (but now labeled

3, 4, 7 and 6, 4, 2 in ascending order) as a side-effect. Then, change the orientation on the circle in the

middle and the right-hand slope to have labels and arrows properly arranged.

         The appeal of this variant is that it offers the minimum deviation from counting order in cyclically

ordered triplets: only one ( 2 6 4 ) is out of order in this labeling. But mo re extreme variations can also be

found, which are strictly combinatoric in nature. Feza Gursey, a pioneer in the study of "theory of every-

thing" models employing the exceptional Lie algebras like E6 , used a labeling system which didn't display

XORing, but did offer some analogy to tensor-indexing schemes general relativity theorists might use.

Other physicists focused on model-building with unusual algebras have also used this scheme, or - like

Susumu Okubo[10] - a sign-flipped variant (the 7 in Gursey's version has its sign reversed, yielding the

diagram in the middle at the bottom of this page.)

         Some recent work of great interest has focused on exploiting the 2- and 3-term cross-products

which are unique to the Octonions. (The familiar cross-product based on the Quaternions, and adapted

since Gibbs to "vector mechanics," has no other true analogues[11], and they also have a "G2 " symmetry.)




         Onar Aam and Geoffrey Dixon have been especially fond of numbering schemes based on mod-

ulo-7 arithmetic, rather than XORing, and hence don't even use the PSL(2,7) representation. Instead, they

draw triangular circuits (one per O-trip) connecting the vertices of a heptagon, as shown above.




                                                        Page 8
           The cyclicality of indices seems the major draw here. With modulo 7 arithmetic, one can avail

oneself of more than one equivalent way of representing this: ei * ei+1 = ei+5 is isomorphic to ei * ei+2 =

ei+3 , and mirror-opposite (through the vertical) to ei * ei+1 = e3 ( or ei * ei+2 = ei+6 ). By developing special

"X," "XY," and "WXY" products based upon the Octonions' cross-product structures, Dixon[12] has used

his heptagonal indices in deep studies of 16- and 24-D exotica of great interest to superstring theorists, the

closest-packing-pattern lattices of Barnes-Wall and Leech respectively. Aam, meanwhile, has done fasci-

nating work on Octonion cross-product symmetries, leading him to construct things Tony Smith calls

"onarhedra" - and which, I discovered near the end of writing this monograph, are 8-D isomorphs of the

"box-kites" I'd independently derived from 16-D configurations of zero-divisors. (After reading this paper,

a visit to Smith's web-site is highly recommended, where the pages on Aam's "cross-product" work will

show amazing correspondences - once one adjusts to notational and intuitional differences - to the entities

I've called "strut signatures" and "tray-racks," for instance. All of which gives further confirmation of the

profundity, qua derivation algebra at least, of the "G2 connection" between Octonions and Sedenions.)

          The 480 different multiplication tables usually thought to be equivalent ways of working with

Octonions may seem like a lot - until one computes how many one must deal with in higher-dimensional

cases. For the Octonions, the 30 distinct combinatorial variations (up to signing) result from dividing 7! =

168 x 30 by the internal symmetry group of the finite projective plane whose labels and arrows we've

played with - the 168-element simple group, PSL(2,7). With the Sedenions, we have to divide 15! ~ 1.24 x
  15
10     by PGL(4,2) = 8!/2 = 20,160 (the symmetry group of finite projective space), then multiply that by

                                                       15 - 4
the number of sign-flip-only possibilities: 2,048 = 2           (4 = number of generators via Cayley-Dickson

process, 3 for Octonions). The result is half a trillion . . . and these, as we'll see, are not equivalent!

          The Sedenions' indices can be placed on the 15 vertices of the finite projective tetrahedron with

35 lines of 3 points each, one per triplet, 7 lines intersecting in each point and 3 planes in each line, imply-

ing 1 Octonion triangle + its 7 lines x (2 - 1) distinct planes through each = 15 planes isomorphic to the

PSL(2,7) triangle. The picture is from p. 139 of Lohmu s et al., where it found its way to Tony Smith's

web-site, where I first encountered it. But mostly, working with triplets directly will seem far more natural

and easy.

          While Moreno generates his G2 analysis in the usual "top-down" manner, giving but one instance

of an actual zero-divisor pair in his paper, my own bias is toward "bottom-up" constructivism. The process

of creating actual zero-divisor pairs will occupy us next. Our short-term goal will be to provide all things

necessary for revealing the 42 Assessors, proving their completeness, and generating "GoTo lists" for the

seven O-trips which will provide necessary and sufficient kindling to spark all this. (We'll see, too, that all

but seven of the S-trips are included in passing - three in fact, per O-trip GoTo list. The exclusion of seven

others from all such lists will be proven by our "Behind the Eight-Ball Theorem" late in our construction

work, and will motivate another tabulation, the "Osiris Partition," from which box kites will fly.)




                                                    Page 10
 { II } Creating Something from Nothing (Three Production Rules):

    Quartets of imaginary units written per the notational conventions given above form valid zero-

dividing pairs if the following obtains:



    (A, B) x (C, D) = 0 <U+00F3> (A xor C) - (D xor B) = (A xor D) - (C xor B) = 0.



    Alternatively, given the correlation between signing and left-right orientation as one moves in

sequence in an associative triplet's 3-cycle, we could just as readily write the above rule this way:



    (A, B) x (C, D) = 0 <U+00F3> (A xor C) + (B xor D) = (A xor D) + (B xor C) = 0.



    In the realm of the Octonions, only trivial cases entailing null or non-distinct letters can occur. This is

certainly connected to the fact that each of the seven Octonion triplets has exactly one unit in common with

any other triplet. Translating this into conditions among Sedenions is not immediately obvious, however.

First, any product like the above implies six different triplets, since each Sedenion index pair belongs to the

triplet containing its XOR product. Hence, A and B form a triplet with A xor B = X, while C and D form

another with C xor D = Y. Moreover, the requirements just given mandate that two pairs among the six

must necessarily share a term each: (A, C) and (B, D) share some E; (A, D) and (B, C) share some F.

    In fact, we can say more than this. Since the Octonions and their copies contain but seven imaginary

units, and the explicit requirements for zero-dividing already exhaust six, then:

    Lemma: Given two Co-Assessors (A, B) and (C, D), A xor B and C xor D have the same index G.

    This clearly implies that the units involved in multiplication can be arranged in both Assessors so that

(A xor B ) - ( C xor D) = 0, without effect on the end result. This "axiom of choice" will be of great use in

the proof behind our second production rule. For the moment, though, we provide, prove, and apply

    Production Rule #1 ("Three-Ring Circuits"). Given a pair of Co-Assessors (A, B) and (C, D), a new

Assessor ( E, F ), mutually zero-dividing with both its progenitors, can be created by assigning the new

letters to the two distinct XOR's ( A xor D = C xor B; A xor C = D xor B ).

    Proof: Do the zero-dividing arithmetic, keeping track of the triplet cycles as they reveal themselves.




                                                    Page 11
                    C +      D

                   A +      B

    [B xor C = ] + F        + E [ = B xor D ]            => ( B, C, F ); ( B, D, E )

    [A xor C = ] - E         - F[ = A xor D ]            => ( D, A, F ); ( C, A, E )

                        0



    Now, substituting from the associative triplets listed to the right, form products of ( E + F ) with the

initiating Co-Assessors, allowing for unknown signing via the "sg" variable:



         E    + sg F                                               E    + sg F

         A     +    B                                              C    +    D

         - D - sg C                                                + B - sg A

         + C + sg D                                                - A + sg B

         0 <U+00F3> sg = (+1)                                             0 <U+00F3> sg = (-1)



    Clearly, exactly one of these must be true for fixed sg. By moving sg between lines of a product, it is

obvious that we get a collection of six distinct product-pairs involving ( A + B ), ( C + D) , and ( E + F ).

As we make zero by multiplying the Assessors in some sequence, we are forced to switch from DOS to

UNIX paths in one of two cross-over sequences, the knot theorist's trefoil (dduddu), or else the "unknot" of

a "triple zigzag" (dududu). In the GoTo Listings, the first of each O-trip's 4 columns displays, in 3 conse-

cutive lines, the first half of its sole zigzag's 6-cycle; the other 3 columns show the 3 trefoil couplings.

    Dynamic Content. Whether trefoil or zigzag, the dynamics are analogous - and require adapting the

usual exponential power-orbit to the special requirements of their nonassociative (and even non-alternative)

world. The complex domain's exp(ix) = cos x + i*sin y requires various "correction terms" to work in less

orderly settings. An Assessor's pair of imaginaries indexed ( A + B ) can't simply be recast as exp( iA )

(cos x + iC sin y), A xor C = + B, with a Co-Assessor indexed ( D + E ) being recast similarly. For the

zero to show in the product, the sine and cosine terms in the right-hand parentheses must evaluate last.



                                                     Page 12
          The simplest way to guarantee this is by fiat: define a "zip" (Zero-divisor Indigenous Power-

orbit) function. Ignoring internal signing for simplicity, for Assessor indices ( A, B ) and ( C, D ), and

angular variables x and y, write products of the circular motions in the two Assessor planes like this:



    zip( A, B; x ) * zip( C, D; y )   = ( cos x * iA + sin x * iB ) * ( cos y * iC + sin y * iD )

                                      = ( cos ( x + y ) * i[A xor C] ) + ( sin ( x - y ) * i[D xor A] )




    We know, from our first production rule, how to interpret this: two currents with opposite clockwise

senses or "chirality," spawned by angular "currents" in two Co-Assessors' planes, manifest as alternately

con- and de- structive wave interference effects, in the plane spanned by the third Assessor they mutually

zero-divide. In this "toy model," patterns readily recognizable as Lissajous figures would sweep through

the origin, "showing on the oscilloscope" in accordance with the opposing currents' relative velocities

(provided, of course, their ratio only involved small integers).

    This is, of course, vastly simplified: just one Co-Assessor trio's interactions require considering six

dimensions of toroidal "plumbing," and Assessors can interact directly in two different trios, and indirectly

receive or transmit "pass-along currents" in ways that will require separate study. By the end of the present

investigation, we will have sufficient information to enable the framing of such studies, but insufficient

space to contemplate them further in these pages.

    One point, though, must be made now: thanks to Peixoto's Theorem[13] (well known to dynamicists,

not well known to high-energy physicists), we know that stable flow-patterns on a torus can only be gener-

ated by pairs of oppositely oriented currents with same rational winding number - clearly suggesting that

zero-divisor dynamics in the badlands of Sedenion space could provide the basis for a surprising new kind

of orderliness! (Consider the unpromising mix of dispersion and nonlinearity, yielding the supreme stabili-

ty of soliton waves.) To see how naturally this condition can be met, let's make our "toy model" a bit more

robust. Show the full 6-cycle, assume noncommutativity implies two helically distinct routes through the

cycle, and think of them as generated by a "volley and serve" logic. (That is, the helices "converse," with

the (A,B)-plane-initiated "ping" inducing a (C,D)-plane-based "pong" in some "dt" less than the time it

takes for one full wind around the torus.) Here's "dt"-free for-instances of what this could look like:

         + cos( x + y ) i1 + sin( x - y ) i13                     - cos( x + y ) i1 - sin( x - y ) i13
         + cos( y + z ) i2 - sin( y - z ) i14                     - cos( y + z ) i2 + sin( y - z ) i14
         + cos( z + x ) i3 + sin( z - x ) i15                     - cos( z + x ) i3 - sin( z - x ) i15
         + cos( x + y ) i1 - sin( x - y ) i13                     - cos( x + y ) i1 + sin( x - y ) i13
         + cos( y + z ) i2 + sin( y - z ) i14                     - cos( y + z ) i2 - sin( y - z ) i14
         + cos( z + x ) i3 - sin( z - x ) i15                     - cos( z + x ) i3 + sin( z - x ) i15

         It must be noted, as a caveat, that generalizations of Peixoto's Theorem beyond the 2-torus are

nontrivial, and even problematic in many contexts. But the possibilities in the present case seem so

beautiful that, barring solid evidence to the contrary, pessimism feels too difficult to sustain.

         Two final notes: the ping/pong "dt" is the natural condition for allowing quantization, and as long

as we expect responses to multiplicative acts are not immediate, we can readily construct toroidal flows in a

dynamic "beneath" quantization which are stable in at least the limited 2-torus context. Later, we'll see

that there are 28 "CoAssessor Trios," which suggests a link to the '28' of the D4 Lie algebra which, via

"triality," can underwrite an enormous array of quantized structures. In the "hyperdiamond lattice" ap-

proach - an alternative or complement to the "superstring" theoretics that garner most of the press, linked

with the work of David Finkelstein and Tony Smith and their students - the D4 focus is paramount in many

respects. And, as one can readily discover by browsing his website, Smith has suggested its connection to

the 28 "S-trips" in the Sedenions. I would suggest here that a deeper connection to the Sedenions may be

found through the CoAssessor Trios - which brings up my second point.

         The "triality" among zero-divisors forming a Trio has crucial elements not like the 2-torus at all -

or at least not like it in any obvious way. What family of functions A, B, C and/or D, E, F can effect some

kind of circuit in a Trio's 6-cycle, returning to some analog of "start-up mode"? Or (analogous to Fourier

series), can create a cycle which will behave as if we'd had it as our starting point, irrespective of what sort

of messiness the resonance emerged from? What fourfold function families can be envisioned for circuits

involving quartets of zero-divisors (which we'll be calling "tray-racks" later)? Can some dense set of such

constructs be built upon a Peixoto-style "bedrock" of 2-torus stable flows, or are things far wackier than

this? Do we need a dynamic model based on "quick-hit" interventions and stably regulated jumps, akin to

the needle-sticking redirecting of the flow of chi in acupuncture?

      Production Rule #2 ("Skew-Symmetric Twisting"). Given Co-Assessors (A, B) and (C, D), precisely

two new Assessors, unable to be Co-Assessors with either propagator but Co-Assessors with each other,

can be created by exchanging one lettered unit from within one Assessor's parentheses with one from the

other, then flipping the sign associated with one or the other unit in the resultant.

     Preliminary Remarks. Since exchanging A and D is effectively indistinguishable from exchanging B

and C, the four possible pair-swaps reduce to but two. Without loss of generality, we can then say that the

restriction to "precisely one" means either ( A + D )( C - B ) or ( D + B )( C - A ) = 0, but not both.

     Proof. By the earlier lemma, we can arrange the writing order of the terms in the parentheses of the

two Co-Assessors we apply the rule to so that the XOR's of the terms internal to the parentheses have

opposite sign. That is, for ( A + B )( C + D ), we arrange our labeling so that A xor B = + G, and C xor D =

- G. This gives O*-trip sequences ( A, B, G ) and ( D, C, G ) respectively. (Note: write O*- and not O-

trip, as we are necessarily dealing with an Octonion copy! All but one of the O*-trips within it will, of

necessity, be S-trips and hence not be contained within the list of seven O-trips proper given earlier. More

on this later!)

     Maintaining the same notation otherwise as with our prior proof for Production Rule #1, yields the

other O*-trip sequences: ( B, C, F ) and ( D, A, F ); and ( B, D, E ) and ( C, A, E ). Let's do the arithmetic:



          C - B                                           C - A

          A + D                                           D + B

          +G + E                                         +F + G

          -E - G                                         +G - F

              0                                             2G



     Clearly, the left-hand product is generated by a new pair of Assessors. Just as clearly, products of

either with either generator will result in real units, since each got one letter each from each propagator. In

normed units, the "2G" result in the right-hand product reduces in fact to plus or minus the normed

imaginary unit produced by the internal XOR-ing described above.




                                                     Page 15
     These two production rules can be combined in two ways. First, Rule #1 can be run on the results of

Rule #2. But also, Rule #2 can be run on the results of Rule #1! This means successive applications of the

two rules turn two Assessors into twelve . . . a result strong enough to require a

    Proof. No checking is needed for each Assessor pair before the Twisting and that created after it. We

need, though, to check that results of the three Twistings do not duplicate each other ( 3 x 2 = 6 tests), and

do not recreate the third Assessor related to each Twisting's propagating pair by Production Rule #1. By

shared letters, the six Assessors created by Twisting, can each only require testing for distinctness against

one of each of the two other Twistings' Co-Assessor pairs, which means ( 3 x 4 )/2 = 6 separate tests. So

12 tests in all are called for to complete the proof, which symmetry can reduce to 6. Consider the Twisting

of ( A + B ) with ( E - F), which produces ( A - F ) and ( E - B ). Test both against ( C + D ); ( A - F )

against ( C - B ) and ( E + D ); and, ( E - B ) against ( A + D ) and ( C + F ).

    We choose this Twisting to examine, because it completes the full mapping of the Octonion copy by

resolving the seventh O*-trip we know must exist in such a copy. We know ( A, B, G ), and this Assessor

pair requires this to be negated by E xor F. Therefore, the seventh O*-trip reads: ( E, G, F ). For conveni-

ence, all seven O*-trips in our O-copy are collected together now:



    ( A, B, G ); ( A, E, C ); ( A, F, D ); ( B, C, F ); ( B, D, E ); ( C, G, D ); ( E, G, F )



    Here's a sequence of six quick calculations to conclude the proof:

( A - F )( C + D ) = ( - E - F + B - A ) FAILS!             ( E - B )( C + D ) = ( + A - B - F - E ) FAILS!

( A - F )( C - B ) = ( - E - G + B + C ) FAILS!             ( A - F )( E + D ) = ( + C - F - G - A ) FAILS!

( E - B )( A+ D ) = ( - C - B + G - E ) FAILS!              ( E - B )( C + F ) = ( + A - G - F + C ) FAILS!



    Masochists who won't take "arguments by symmetry" at face value are encouraged to spend a minute

or two crunching out three more lines of calculations. They may also enjoy playing with the four-unit

products resulting from all failed results. Each includes precisely two terms from its producers, and, with

norming assumed, they are all in fact square roots of minus unity, as can be checked quite quickly. (All




                                                        Page 16
 cross-products among the four letters cancel, the squares of the units sum to -4 within the parentheses, and

the norming of the producing terms mandates the coefficient of the parenthesized listings above be <U+00BD>.)

    After a little playing around like this, though, an earlier failure should return to your thoughts, which

also resulted in an Imaginary (instead of pregnantly Empty) result. What was it about the second possible

Twist result that made it fail? This is related, of course, to our exercising the free choice our earlier lemma

showed was our prerogative. And perhaps it is related to another fact tossed off in a parenthetical remark a

few lines back. Of the seven O*-trips in an Octonion copy, only (and exactly) one can actually be an O-trip

proper . . . belong, that is, to the genuine Octonions (index < 8 ) prior to their extension to Sedenions.

    Let's mull on this for a minute, beginning our thinking with a new convention. To always be clear

which units have index > 7 (pure Sedenions), we will use letter variables that are Upper Case only, such as

'S'; correspondingly, pure Octonions will be written exclusively with lower case lettering ('o'). No copy

O* of the genuine Octonions can be all S's, for the XOR of any two will produce a Zero in the leftmost bit,

and hence result in an o. Ditto, all o's means the genuine O, hence no division by Zero. But one of each

mandates two of each by XORing (o xor S = some S'; S xor S' = some o'), and two o's have a third as

product, completing an O-trip.

    The third o, when XORing with S and S', must produce at least one new S, call it S''. Suppose the

first o forms an associative triple with S and S'. Then either o' or o'' must form an S-trip with two S's

distinct from both of these. This leaves us with 3 o's and 4 S's, which completes the O*. But suppose o'

does not form an associative triple with S and S'. Then either o' or o'' must form an S-trip with them

instead, which leads to the same result. Hence, any O* not identically the genuine O must have 3 o's and 4

S's exactly.

    Our Co-Assessor pairs explicitly require writing with four letters. All four cannot be o's, lest we be in

the genuine O. We cannot have one o or S, and three S's or o's, lest multiplying require an S xor o to equal

an S xor S or an o xor o, which is impossible if we're to end up with Zero. So either all must be S's (which

we'll see is impossible); or, we must have two of each.

    Suppose the latter is the case. Then we can have it two ways: (1) the o's are combined to make one

Assessor, and the S's, the other; or, (2) an Assessor must have one of each. Regardless of which case we

start with, the two possible Twists the proof of Production Rule #2 required we test (swapping terms on the




                                                     Page 17
 same or opposite sides of the middle + or -) will result in exactly one case of each Co-Assessor pairing.

And we know that exactly one of their multiplications must always fail. Which suggests the

     "Exogamous Moieties" Rule. It is forbidden for the two letters on either side of an Assessor's central

'+' or '-' to belong to the only O-trip among an O-copy's seven associative triplets. Put another way, the

two units whose marriage constitutes an Assessor must belong to different halves or "moieties"of the

Sedenion tribe. One must be a pure Octonion or 'o'; the other must be a pure Sedenion or 'S'.

     Proof. Consider the ways of picking two units. If moiety didn't matter, then other things being equal,

there should be (7x6)/(2x1) = 21 possibilities. Picking 2 of 3 o's can happen 3 ways; picking 2 of 4 S's,

(4x3)/(1x2) = 6 ways; and picking one of each can be accomplished 3x4 = 12 ways, which three options

tally, of course, to 21. But we have found precisely 12 Assessors linked to any given O-trip. Moreover,

without even knowing actual index numbers for any actual cases yet, we can write them out abstractly and

catch the pattern anyway. Writing each Co-Assessor triple in a separate column, we have this array:



          ( A, B )            ( A, G )            ( A, D )            ( A, F )

          ( C, D )            ( C, F )            ( C, B )            ( C, G )

          ( E, F )            ( E, D )            ( E, G )            ( E, B )



     If our assertion be true, then A, C, E are an O-trip (and should be written "a, c, e" by our casing con-

vention). In the first test of Production Rule #2, it was ( A, C ) ( D, B ) which failed. Rewritten to show

casing, this is ( a, c ) ( D, B ), confirming our hypothesis. Moreover, twisting ( A, B ) ( E, F ) fails for the

( a, e ) ( B, F ) product only; likewise, ( C, D ) ( E, F ) has ( c, e ) ( D, F ) as a failed twist product. And

easy calculations show this obtains with the three other columns as well.

     The last possibility for failure of the proof is the four-S case, which we'd placed to the side. And how-

ever we form an instance of it, all four XOR products must be o's. But then "Exogamous Moieties" must

be invoked, and so the First Production Rule must fail, which contradicts the claim we have a Co-Assessor

pair in the first place. Q.E.D.

     Afterthoughts: How To Instantiate and Interpret an "O-Copy": The "letter logic" of the just conclud-

ed argument is not quite a concrete tool for producing a verifiable "O-Copy." For that, we need to massage




                                                        Page 18
 the labels by making use of the last theorem in Moreno's paper (the solitary corollary of which is his "G2

homomorphism" result). Put simply, he proves that if we have two units a, b which associate, and a third

we label y which anti-associates with them - ( ay )b = - a( yb ), in other words - then a, b and y provide

necessary and sufficient material for spawning a copy of the Octonions. A mapping from (a,y,b)-generated

terms to the Octonion index set is made by this sequence of assignments:



                                  ( a, b, ab, (ay)b, yb, ay, y ) <U+00E8> ( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 )



    Let's set the O-trip ( A E C ) from our proof apparatus to be ( a, b, ab ); and, let's pick D for our y.

Plugging in the rest of our letters into the mapping machinery gives us these assignments:



         ( a, b, ab, (ay)b, yb, ay, y ) <U+00E8> ( A, E, C, -G, B, -F, D ) <U+00E8> ( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 )



    To give this a test drive, let's stuff some numbers. Pick ( a, b, c ) to be the Quaternions' ( 1, 2, 3 ) and

then search the GoTo Listings until we get a Co-Assessor Trio associated with this O-trip which induces

minimal signing messiness when we run it through the steps of our proofs. Here's the result:



    ( 1 + 14 )( 3 + 12 ) = ( 3 + 12 )( 2 - 13 ) = 0 <U+00E8> ( A + B )( C + D ) = ( C + D )( E - F ) = 0



    All that's missing is G, but since AB = FE = G, G must be 15. That means we get this map:



                             ( 1, 2, 3, -15, 14, -13, 12 ) <U+00E8> ( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 )



    Since all GoTo Listings for a given O-trip share the same quartet of Sedenion units, the "O-copies"

associated with each of the four O-trip's four Co-Assessor trios will employ the same (albeit differently

signed) units in their mappings. Hence the Listings refer not to an automorphism, but an "automorpheme"

(e.g., set of "constituent units," as they say in structural linguistics, from which an actual Co-Assessor trio's

automorphisms are generated) when listing the seven imaginaries from which O-copies are made.



                                                         Page 19
     There is a secondary reason for introducing this subtle distinction: while we do, in fact, have copies of

the Octonions, and hence O-copies in the sense used above, the "isomorphism" Moreno depends upon in

fact entails a crucial loss of information. If we take the mapping just provided and generate the constituent

O-trips for the terms on the right of the arrow, we'll see they don't quite match the S-trips which spawned

the listing on the left. We have, in fact, two signing conflicts.

    ( 3, 4, 7 ) maps to ( 3, -15, 12 ) ~ ( 3, 12, 15 ). Our Sedenion table shows the S-trip as ( 3, 15, 12 ).

    ( 3, 6, 5 ) maps to ( 3, -13, 14 ) ~ ( 3, 14, 13 ). Our Sedenion table shows the S-trip as ( 3, 13, 14 ).

    This is a possibility which Moreno apparently didn't consider: indeed, the only concrete instance he

offers of his "special triples" theorem is, perversely, one which has no zero-divisors: a, b, y = 1, 2, 7 . . .

which generates not an O-copy, but the Octonions proper! Moreover, the signing conflict cannot be re-

moved by permuting the signs on the underlying units. This is best checked on the Octonion side of the

mapping, as there are only 480 equivalent multiplication tables. These partition into 30 combinatorially

different placements on the PSL(2,7) triangle with same signing, times 16 identically labeled, differently

signed, placements. The XOR requirement made at the onset restricts us completely as to combinatorial

varying. We are, therefore, restricted to the 16 signing variants. But these in fact can be reduced by half,

since each multiplication table has an "opposite" table with all arrows reversed.

    We are down, then, to eight variants, each of which is generated by changing the sign on at least one

unit, and hence the orientation of the 3 arrows which pass through it. But we needn't look at any of them

explicitly, since the fact that any two O-trips share precisely one unit is all we need to know to prove this

    Lemma. Permuting signs on units changes 3 or 4 arrows, or all or none.

    Proof. Changing one unit's sign flips 3 arrows. Changing any two flips 6 - 2 = 4 arrows (since sign-

change is an involution, the O-trip with both units is left unchanged). Changing all 3 members of an O-trip

changes all arrows (the O-trip in question is flipped thrice = once; all other O-trips share but one, so get one

flip). Changing all 4 units not in some O-trip changes no arrows (the excluded O-trip is left untouched, and

all others are toggled twice). Changing 3 ( = 4 - 1 ) units which are not an O-trip therefore changes 3. By

duality of opposite multiplication tables (there being but 7 units), this exhausts all possibilities.

    Throwaway Corollary. Since the "canonical" Octonion multiplication table has two O-trips with

cyclical and counting order differing, a table with all O-trips in order in both senses is impossible.




                                                       Page 20
     Implication. Moreno's "isomorphism" between Sedenion subsets which act like O-copies in their

Sedenion context, and systems of units which are multiplicatively equivalent to the Octonions, is only

partial, and breaks down where signing of units (and hence orienting of O-trips) of a true Octonion multi-

plication table is concerned. Moreno's "isomorphism" also doesn't capture sign-related information that's

clearly germane to Co-Assessor Trios. ("Homomorphism to G2 ," where roots or "zeros" are concerned,

says nothing about the sign-based distinction between zigzags and trefoils: it merely points to the existence

of "distinct" 6-cycle orbits of some kind - and it's even ambiguous about what "distinct" means, since not

just our second production rule, but the third we'll see next, could claim, for different reasons, to define it.)

    Moral: Tools derived from Lie algebra shouldn't be assumed to work as planned with things that are

not Lie algebras. When determining laws about apples from the study of oranges, concrete data should at

least be looked at before claiming they fit the facts! (Else there may be hell to pay later, as we'll find out!)

This much said, here, then, are some further facts: the two mis -signed triplets are not due to a "mistake" by

Moreno, they also are built in to the abstract "letter logic" of our proofs (readers are encouraged to test this

out for themselves). More peculiar still, all the mis -signed triplets are the same triplets, regardless of what

Sedenions or O-trips are used to feed Moreno's mapping machine. Further, all excluded Sedenions (and

jump ahead to the "8-Ball Theorem" to see just what this means) generate "normal" Octonion multiplica-

tion tables. These are computable facts, whose underlying reasons we leave, for now, as mysteries.

This table was built by listing the 7 associative Octonion triplets in ascending cyclic order, then populating
the first column in each such O-trip's "GoTo Listing" with the first 3 Co-Assessor pairings in its unique
"triple zigzag" Trio's 6-cycle. (The cycle's last 3 pairings are identical but for internal signing.) The 1st,
2nd , and 3rd rows in the 2nd , 3rd and 4th columns are the zigzag's same-rowed (L, R) to (-R, L) Twist results.
Twists based on other (trefoil) columns are (L,R) to (R, -L). The bottom row of the 2nd column's Twist is
on the 3rd column's bottom, with Twists in other columns likewise on a diagonal, but oppositely oriented
with respect to movements up or down the 6-cycle. The Twists for the 3rd and 4th columns, meanwhile,
mirror the orientations just described for the 1st and 2nd columns, respectively. There is a "musical round"
aspect to trefoils, too, one of the 3 Twists for columns 2, 3, 4 requiring its target (column 4, 2, 3) be rolled
forward half a cycle. 6-cycle x 4 columns x 7 O-trips = 168 Co-Assessor couplings = PSL(2,7)'s order.



                                                     Page 22
      We now know that for each of the 7 O-trips there are 12 Assessors, one for each pairing of the three O-

trip letters and the four O-copy Sedenions. By symmetry, the 6 pairings among these latter four units must

form S-trips, and in such a manner that two uniquely match with each O-trip unit.

     But each o appears in 3 automorphemes, while at the same time belonging to (28)/(7) = 4 distinct S-

trips. The 6 S-trips containing the common o cannot, therefore, be distinct. But any one of 3 automor-

phemes sharing an o must share an S-trip with one of the others; moreover, it cannot share its other S-trip

containing that o with that same automorpheme, lest they share their O-trip and be isomorphic.

     Applying this to each pair we can pick among the three automorphemes sharing an o, leads to this

     Lemma. Any two of the 3 automorphemes generating GoTo listings, and sharing an Octonion, share

exactly 2 Sedenions, with the 2 each excludes from the other being shared with the third one. An obvious

corollary is

     Production Rule #3. The unique automorpheme which shares the o and S of another's Assessor will

also contain that Assessor, and be the only distinct automorpheme to do so in the whole Sedenion space.

Suppose, in the first instance, the O-trip for Assessor ( a + B ) is ( a, c, e ) and in the second, is ( a, m, n).

We can solve for the Co-Assessors of the two ( a + B ) instances we know exist in the second case by

setting up the usual XOR apparatus. Plug in either new O-trip unit and solve for the missing S, like this:



     ( a + B )( m + sg S ) <U+00F3> a xor sg S = m xor B; [ a xor m = ]n = sg S xor B.



     Applying the other production rules to the resultant Assessor coupling yields some surprises: systems

of Assessor triplicities emerge, filling the vertex structure (but only half the eight sides) of an octahedral

array. These arrangements of alternating "sails" and "vents" are called box-kites in what follows. To

properly appreciate them, we have one more mystery to unravel.

     From our last lemma, it's clear that the 3 automorphemes P, Q, R sharing the same o collectively use

up 6 of the possible 8 S's. However they are labeled, P will share 2 of its 4 S's with Q and the other 2 with

R. And this is true for all automorphemes containing zero-divisors, and sharing an o: any 3 among the 7

O-trips with an o in common will therefore obey this distribution rule. In each case, there must be an S

which is explicitly excluded, and XORing between it and the 3 O-trip units will generate the other 3




                                                       Page 23
 excludes. Is the same S excluded in all cases? Looking now at the table, the evidence is clearly yes, which

leads to our

     "Behind the 8-Ball Theorem". No automorpheme which can be used to produce Assessors can con-

tain the index-8 Sedenion.

    The table shows the "8-Ball" theorem as clearly as a proof: for GoTo #1, the O-trip is (1,2,3), and the

exclude list is {8, 8+1, 8+2, 8+3}; for GoTo #2, the O-trip is (1,4,5), and the exclude list is { 8, 8+1, 8+4,

8+5 } . . . and so on. The reason for this mysterious behavior is very simple. The lower three bits of the 8-

Ball are 000, making it the identity of the group of XOR operations among the Octonions' indices - the

role exclusively enacted by the Real unit among the Octonions in their own domain. Hence, 8 xor o, o any

Octonion index, will always be 8 + o. As any o belongs to 3 O-trips, whose units include all the Octonions,

clearly no XORing with any other Sedenion could hope to satisfy the unit-exclusion requirements for all 7

O-trips. Indeed, for any Octonion o, none but 8 and 8 + o could do so for all three O-trips sharing it! Yet

this is the minimum required, given the share-and-exclude symmetry discussed above.

    The collection of seven 4-D spheres, or "balls," consisting of Quaternion copies based on the S-trip

made by any o and the index-8 Sedenion, is the only such set not riven by Zero-Dividing "slash planes."

(Not just lines, since any real coefficients attached to Zero-Dividing axes yield points which Zero-Divide

                                                                               N                     N
each other.) This concretizes a result of Moreno's (Zero-Dividers span 2 -4 dimensions in 2 -dimensional

imaginary realms, N > 3) and suggests a unit-based table to make "box-kites" easy to derive.

    The slash-free image of the 8-Ball further suggests the Egyptian myth of Osiris, who was hacked into

14 "units" by his evil brother Set, leaving his wife and sister Isis with the Humpty-Dumpty work. The next

table, then, is called the Osiris Partition, and shows the labels for the 7 Octonion units running down the

left, with those for the 7 viable Sedenions running across the top. The main diagonal is all null. The other

42 cells each show all four appearances, in Co-Assessor trios, of the Assessor whose indices label the cell.

These are indicated by a pair of GoTo Numbers, each linked to the two Co-Assessors' indices.

    The process of converting data from the Osiris Partition into box-kite drawings is a lot like a "Knight's

Tour" problem. Here, the game board is 7x7 instead of the usual 8x8 used in chess, but the logic is similar.

Pick a square, and write the cell's o and S numbers in parentheses as vertex labels on a triangle. In the

triangle's center, put the GoTo Number. The pair of Assessor coordinates, listed in the cell with the GoTo



                                                       Page 24
 Number, go on the triangle's other corners. Attach another triangle, bow-tie fashion, to the first, put the

second GoTo Number inside, and label its free vertices with the other Assessors' indices. Jump to the cell

of an Assessor whose indices you've put on a corner, and repeat the process until you complete a "tour."

You won't hit all squares, but you will get an octahedral vertex figure (in one of seven ways).

         We will take a close look at these "box kites" in the next section. Before we begin to examine

them, the reader should consider their duals, the septet of "Dunkin' Donuts" implicit in the remarks made at

the bottom of the GoTo Listings table. Each 6-cycle by 4-trio array can be made into wallpaper, with the

contrasting up and down rhythms of the Twist results vis <U+00E0> vis cycling direction leading to a natural repre-

sentation as a toroidal two-flow system: the dunked donut moves down, the coffee's sucked up. While 6-

cycling joins Assessors as vertices on box-kites, twisting joins up edges that link Co-Assessors, forming

torus maps: draw a square and its diagonals, placing four Assessors from the same GoTo List and with the

same o in the middle; put the four Assessors sharing the O-trip's second o in pairs at North and South; put

the last four Assessors, sharing the third o, in pairs at West and East. Each half-diagonal is a join of two

edges which are each other's Twist product; each edge of the square is likewise pasted to its opposite num-

ber, making the torus. Each of the four triangles defines a Co-Assessor trio residing on a different box-kite.

         Neither box-kites nor dunkin' donuts can facilitate a complete Knight's Tour; but by playing these

two dual systems off each other (like veins and arteries? Right brain, left brain? Ida and Pingala? Yin and

Yang?), such a tour is readily conducted - even if there is no "group structure" to make the job description

obvious!

         We can take leave of the Assessors proper and consider their ensembles with Production Rule #0

("Seinfeld Production"). Pick a random Octonion unit o (7 ways), then a random pure Sedenion which

isn't the 8-Ball or its XOR with o (6 ways); the rest follows. Or pick a random non-index-8 Sedenion (7

ways), then any o whose index isn't the XOR of that Sedenion with 8 ( 6 ways ); yadda, yadda, yadda.

 { III } Box-Kites, Lanyards, and Strut Signatures:

         The Lie algebraist's toolkit is the historical result of assimilation of imaginary units and their pro-

geny into the orthodoxy of Number. As this century's countless failures to deal with bare charge, raw sin-

gularities of caustics, and so forth, make clear, the adjunction of Zero made by late medieval accountants to

the realm of number still hasn't been fully integrated into the general population of arithmetical entities.

Which makes concrete immersion in the actual phenomena being thought about all the more critical if real

progress is to be made in understanding them.

         The construction and "flying" of box-kites will take us a large step past these impasses. Let's start

with the image of a "mock octahedron." In one G2 view, they belong to a set of 7 isomorphic objects. In

another, each organizes 12 sets of entities into two same-sized classes. An Assessor sits on each of the 6

vertices, each composed of two distinct lines which only zero-divide in different contexts. The vertices are

all at unit distance from the origin, and have a square frame, and so on. But, due to the "quadruple cover-

ing" needed to accommodate +( A + B ) at each, only the eight pyramids formed by each face and the ori-

gin are truly isomorphic (via "piecewise congruence") with a 3-D octahedron. The need, while circuiting

along pathways joining mutually zero-dividing points, to flip from DOS to UNIX paths requires a certain

trompe d'oeil (analogous to the hot-swapping of hard drives in a multi-protocol machine) if we're to keep

the illusion going. For when these pieces are spliced together in 12-D, vertices on opposite ends of any of

the three axes are a mere edge-distance apart - an Escher-like impossibility in 3-D!

         The box-kite image (and octahedral box-kites are hardly unlikely) actually conveys some deep

information, albeit by analogy. Call the four triangles which come from our O-trip tables "sails," and the

four situated between them so as to prevent any two sails from sharing an edge "vents." In everyday

spacetime, sails are 2-D sheets of silk or mylar, say, while vents allow passage of the 4-D object called

wind. The situation here is remarkably akin. Our sails live in copies of the 8-D Octonions; the Assessor

trios we call vents, though, require the full 16-D of "Sedenion wind" to operate in (which, as with real-

world kites, is double the dimensionality of the sails).

         The box-kite also has structural features which correspond to new relations among Assessors. The

square frames (one per each of the three axis pairings) are a new kind of arrangement that can't exist within

the confines of an O-copy, yet which are as dynamically legitimate as the trios who comprise the sails and



                                                     Page 27
 vents. Even the struts have meaning for us, since they serve to keep diagonally opposite Assessors apart

(such pairs don't zero-divide), while at the same time letting them work as higher-order components (the 4-

unit additive sum of Assessors at opposite corners is itself a zero-divisor . . . and the three such composites

derived one from each strut form a Co-Assessor trio).

         To get started, we need some new diagramming logic - something like one might find, say, in the

theory of directed graphs - to streamline our picture of how Assessors interact. And we also need to con-

ceive some new kind of entity to formally encapsulate what these interactions comprise. As our aim is to

domesticate Zero, the decimal system place-holder, let's call it a "lanyard," the string that serves as a place-

holder for beads, charms, and other trinkets when building a necklace or bracelet. (Differently parsed as

"LAN yard," it also suggests a collection of servers tied together to form a Local Area Network.)

         The lanyard should roughly do for multiplicative relationships devolving upon Zero, what the for-

mal idea of a group does for additive ones. The orbits of a unit's powers (or those of e which mime those)

likewise form closed loops of numeric thread. Lanyards should emulate these more familiar "necklaces,"

offering similar service in a different context. The lanyard needs a Zero, so that B + 0 = B for all "beads" B

belonging to it. And it needs a notion of sequencing akin to the Knight's Tour in its lack of redundancy

and completeness of circuiting. We can't say that any two beads B and C have Zero as product; but any

two beads in the lanyard must be reachable without retracings by a sequence of such links, so that adjacent

beads along the way do have Zero products. And, we want to know the necklace has a clasp: that is to say,

the lanyard is closed. That's equivalent to saying we can get from B to C in two directions without any

recrossings - that, in programmer's jargon, the beads make a doubly-linked list.

         Said formally, for all B, A belonging to a lanyard, there exist two indexable sets of lanyard beads

E and D, of m and n elements respectively, such that: 1) B x E1 = 0, Ei x Ei+1 = 0, and Em = A; 2) A x D1

= 0, Di x Di+1 = 0, and Dn x B = 0; and, 3) sets E and D have no beads in common save for those which

terminate in B and A. Finally, all Zero Divisors we know of come in pairs, so a lanyard, to be complete,

must thread both "beads" of each Assessor - and any graphical notation used to write down lanyard struc-

tures must readily distinguish switches from UNIX to DOS paths (henceforth, "u" to "d" - as in, also,

"up" or "down"). Put the indices of beads in circles or parentheses joined by lines, and in the middle of

these lines write a sign: "+" if the two beads share the same internal sign, "-" if these are different.



                                                     Page 28
          This is motivated best by show and tell. We know that Co-Assessor trios have a 6-cycle involving

changes from DOS to UNIX paths (or "down" to "up," or just "d, u" for short). Obviously, the lanyard

definition was framed with things like them in mind. Using the simple graphical convention just outlined,

it is easy to see why trefoils and triple zigzags must be distinguished. Consider all the "lanyard diagrams"

which are possible with three links. If all three links are ( + ), we get a 3-cycle, and by the proof of Produc-

tion Rule #1, we won't get lanyards at all. If we have 2 ( + ) and 1 ( - ) (and order doesn't matter) we get

the trefoil pattern ( A + B => C - D => E - F => A - B ) which will cause both paths of each Assessor to be

included after two circuits. 1 ( + ) and 2 ( - ) would only cover half the bases ( A + B => C - D => E + F

=> A + B ) and doesn't occur with Zero Divisors (and hence as a lanyard) anyway. But all ( - ) yields the

triple zigzag ( A + B => C - D => E + F => A - B ), which does occur.

         Ultimately, a lanyard theory should explain the mysteries, already evident in this simple 3-sign

case, of which patterns make lanyards and which don't, and in which context. Such a theory might get

quite interesting (and prove quite useful) in the high-dimensioned situations looming in the future. For

now, though, lanyard description will be our modest goal. And we're about to find that there are more than

two lanyard types in a box-kite. The box-kite itself forms a 12-cycle lanyard - you can get from any zero-

dividing bead to any other without any retracings, which is not a trivial fact (consider the Traveling Sales-

man problem). And there are a handful of others, too, which we'll get to momentarily.

         The first order of business, though, is to draw the box-kites as lanyard diagrams. This is rather

easy, since all are isomorphic. The chart and graphics which follow summarize the facts which spell this

out. And it bears pointing out that each cell of the Osiris Partition maps to only one box-kite. This implies

that box-kites partition the Assessors without overlap.

         We won't prove the isomorphy of box-kites formally: it follows immediately from placing the

Assessor indices in the slots as the charting indicates, and checking against the GoTo Listings. We need,

then, just a lanyard diagram of the box-kite with abstract letters filling in the slots where actual index-pairs

should go, and a table of values to overwrite these with, in order to generate the box-kites themselves.

Also, a stripped-down Osiris Partition, showing only which box-kites get filled by which cells, is provided

as a visual aid to reflection.

              The box-kite schematic is oriented so that a triple-zigzag sail sits on top, while a triple-zigzag vent

is at the bottom. Up to triangular dihedral symmetry (left-right mirroring, plus rotations in opposite senses,

of A, B and C's lettering in tandem with F, E, D's) this serves to completely specify the structure. Com-

plete consistency of letter schemes across box-kites is achieved by rotating A, B, C into O-trip cyclic order.

Box-kites always have 3 trefoils and 1 triple zigzag among their sails (and also among their vents). In top-

down, left-right order, the 6 Assessors of each box-kite are associated with the letters A - F in the "Strut

Table" which follows, where actual index-pairs for each box-kite's Assessors are listed. (Strut pairs appear

in "nested parentheses" order: AF, BE, CD.) For GoTo numbers, the triple-zigzag's is given first; the next

is for the trefoil extending from the topmost Assessor to the two lowermost on either side; the two sails on

         As mentioned just before the "Osiris Partition" was unveiled, the box-kites have dual structures,

called "Dunkin' Donuts" earlier. Trademark law being what it is, it's not clear whether such a name could

be deemed grounds for legal action, so the diagram above uses an alternative that sounds just the same:

"Duncan Donuts," after the great pioneer of modern dance, Isidora Duncan. Such choreography serves

quite naturally as the "dual" to the "musical round" syncopations of the "GoTo Listings" which these

donuts supplement. One is shown above, with arrows indicating the standard "wallpaper" method for

creating a torus: join top to bottom to get a tube, then join the tube's ends along the edges' arrows.

         The little cartouches with the Roman numerals show the indices of Trios' box-kites. The signs in

brackets tell which way to connect the two big bolded Octonion units with the indicated Sedenions along a

given path. Along the bottom edge, ( 3 + 14 ) zero-divides ( 2 + 15 ), and the arrow shows they can be

pasted by a Twist to the ( 2 - 14 )( 3 + 15 ) at the top. All diagonals are also borders across which Twists

can be performed: ( 3 - 14 )( 1 + 12 ) in Box-Kite V is transformed by Twisting into the CoAssessor Pair

( 3 - 12 )( 1 - 14 ) in Box-Kite VII. (Readers are encouraged to draw the other donuts for themselves.)




                                                           Page 31
           The Roman numerals used to distinguish the box-kites are not arbitrary. They correspond to the

Octonion index numbers, peculiar to each box-kite, which are called herein the strut signatures. Explain-

ing the nature of this box-kite invariant will introduce us to the second major ingredient in Zero Divisor

dynamics, after Co-Assessor trios: the paired square array of Assessor quartets, a sort of "Tray-Rack,"

whose opposite corners are separated by the zero-division-insulating diagonals of the struts.

          As is easily checked on the box-kite diagram, the Tray-Racks associated with the 3 strut pairings

are 4-cycle lanyards. Each consecutive signing as we circuit the square is the reverse of those before and

after, tracing a pattern suggesting the hinged collapsible frames used to support snap-on tray tables. Use

the same letters with different casing, per earlier convention, for each Assessor's units, and write (b + B), (c

- C), (e + E), (d - D). This is a 4-, not 8-, cycle, since two such incomplete lanyards (another starts (b - B))

must thread the same Assessors (along mutually exclusive paths) to buttress the struts. Tours around either

of a Tray-Rack's paired frames never switch tracks without external interference (e.g., from a trefoil or zig-

zag's impetus) - which is where the dynamic interest in their seemingly stable incompleteness resides.

          Since the box-kites and their lanyard diagrams are all isomorphic, the need for deploying abstract

letter variables, so invaluable in deciphering XOR signing and triplet cycles, will be much less. Instead, the

next few paragraphs will frequently make use of one specific set of index values: those for Box-Kite III,

which had the good fortune to be the first discovered, but is otherwise in no way special. There is much to

be gained intuitively from this strategy, and (given box-kite equivalence) nothing to lose.

          Putting together the generic box-kite diagram and the specifics from the last table, the Box-Kite III

struts terminate in Assessor pairs indicated as { A, F }; { B, E }; { C, D }, which we can read off for the

kite in question this way: { ( 7, 12 ), ( 4, 15) }; { ( 5, 14 ), ( 6, 13 ) }; { ( 2, 9 ), ( 1, 10 ) }. Each of the

Assessor pairs in wavy brackets is readily shown to fail the Zero Division test. In all three instances, a

single-unit product results from multiplying, and takes on one of two index values, depending on internal

signing of the index pairs: 3, if signs are the same; 8, if different. Always, we're placed in the Zero-

Divisor-free zone of the "8-Ball" set, with '3' being the strut signature unique to Box-Kite III.

          Proof. (4 + 15)(7 + sg 12) = (6 + 13)(5 + sg 14) = (1 + 10)(2 + sg 9) = (1 - sg)8 + (1 + sg)3.

Uniqueness is verified by visual inspection of the stripped-down Osiris Partition. The Roman numeral

which names each box-kite is the only one never showing in the same-numbered row.




                                                           Page 32
          Note, too, the Roman numerals always appear in mirror-opposite pairs off the empty main diago-

nal. Each such pair in fact forms a strut, which shows the columnar layout logic of the table at the bottom:

each consecutive nesting, from the outermost (A,F) pair to the innermost (C,D) is a strut, for all box kites.

         Visualizations. Consider the PSL(2,7) representation of the Octonion multiplication via the logic

of simplicial decomposition. Let midpoints stand in for edges, and the central point for the triangle as such.

From vertex, through midpoint, to vertex, makes 3 "side triplets"; cycling through midpoints makes one

"median-linking triplet"; from vertex, through center, to midpoint, makes 3 "edge-bisector triplets." Ex-

clude the highest-dimensioned subspace (delete the central point) and the 3 edge-bisector triplets collapse,

to be replaced by the binary struts. Joining all the non-central points yields precisely the geometry of the

box-kite (with its strut signature now representing the index of the removed central unit). A stereographic

picture of the Fano plane (PSL(2,7) qua simplest finite projective geometry), showing octahedral struts and

four "sails" (treated as circles determined by the 3 vertices), has been published by Burkland Polster[14].

         The strut signature also plays another role. Consider the "slash-product, " ( A + B)(A - B), of the

two orthogonal axes which comprise an Assessor ( A, B ). For any box-kite, all slash-products of all

Assessors have index 8 + o, where o is the strut signature. When we add to this the obvious fact that the

square of any normed Assessor axis is the negative real unit, we get this

         Lemma. All non-zero Assessor products within a box-kite are contained within the 8-Ball, and

specifically within the Quaternion copy { 1, o, 8, 8+o }, where o is the strut signature. The only things of

any interest in box-kite product structure, then, are the "stringing" of the Zero's in lanyards, and the string-

ing together of Assessors' units into higher-dimensional composites . . . leading not to Zero-Dividing ortho-

gonal line-pairs like the Assessors, but to denser spaces we'll call Seinfeld hyperplanes.



                                    *         *        *         *        *



         To provide a roadmap for the remainder of this section, here's the three things left to examine

before concerning ourselves with dynamics: 1) Tabulate the box-kite lanyards; 2) Collect the basic facts

about Seinfeld hyperplanes; 3) Boil down our already simplistic "XOR trickery" to a degree so childish as

to make higher-dimensional "box-kite" analysis easy (and give a thumbnail sketch of it for 32-D).




                                                    Page 33
          Let's tackle the last first and be done with it, for it's surprisingly straightforward. Consider Box-

Kite VII, which has a special feature: since its strut signature is the maximal 7, the sum of the indices for

each of its vertices is the maximal 15. All bits must be turned "on" after XORing to achieve this, so we

needn't worry about "dropped bits." Consider the convenience this offers for higher-dimensional extrapo-

lation. In particular, let's focus on the units in 32 dimensions, the "Path-ions" (to give them a name, after

the Cabalists' "32 Paths"; in 64 dimensions, we might speak of "Iching-ions" after the Chinese system of

                                                    4
64 divinatory hexagrams). The one among the 2 - 1 = 15 "hyper-box-kites" with maximal strut signature

                                         3
(of 15) would have, like all the others, 2 - 1 = 7 struts. And since the sum of the indices at each vertex

would be the maximal 31, we can quickly jot them down, joining strut-ends with double arrows:



         ( 1, 30 ) <U+00E7><U+00E8> ( 14, 17 )                  ( 2, 29 ) <U+00E7><U+00E8> ( 13, 18 )             ( 3, 28 ) <U+00E7><U+00E8> ( 12, 19 )

         ( 4, 27 ) <U+00E7> <U+00E8> ( 11, 20 )                 ( 5, 26 ) <U+00E7><U+00E8> ( 10, 21 )             ( 6, 25 ) <U+00E7><U+00E8> ( 9, 22 )

                                                  ( 7, 24 ) <U+00E7><U+00E8> ( 8, 23 )



         Write some code to generate the 155 triplets by Cayley-Dickson process. Then, use the formula
                                                                                 N
presented earlier to crank out the number of triplets for lower-dimensioned 2 -ions: it works for all N.

(The existence and calculable number of triplets, G2 derivation and 8-Ball-like generation, plus the "flexi-

                            P       Q   [P + Q]            N
ble" power law that says X * X = X                for any 2 -ion X, are almost all the structure we're guaran-

teed for indefinitely large N.) Drop anchor in the higher-dimensioned realm via the "maximal strut signa-

ture trick" just elucidated, and mysteries should begin revealing themselves in short order. Some "easy

pickings": <U+00BD> (14)(13) = 91 paths between zero-divisors in each hyper-box-kite, minus the 7 struts, yields

84 Assessors unique to Path-ions in each. Add to these, the 42 inherited from Sedenions, and we have 126

- the number of roots in E7. The 84, meanwhile, cluster into 28 Co-Assessor Trios. (Recall the earlier re-

marks about D4 and Sedenions, and bear in mind that in the 32-D of the Pathions, the "matter from noth-

ing" magic of the Higgs mechanism finds its home in "Hyperdiamond Lattice" thinking.)
                                                                             8
         We know that surprises will keep on coming at least up to the 2 -ions, due to the 8-cyclical struc-

ture of all Clifford Algebras. And we know at least a little about what such surprises will entail: as can



                                                        Page 34
 already be seen in low-dimensioned Clifford Algebras including non-real units which are square roots of

positive one, numbers whose squares and even higher-order powers are 0 will appear. The 8-cycle implies
                                                                                                            Nth
an iterable, hence ever-compoundable pattern, implying in its turn cranking out of numbers which are 2

roots of 0, approaching as a limit-case an analog of the "Argand diagram" whose infinitude of roots form a

"loop" of some sort. If we can work with this it all, it could only be by having as backdrop some sort of

geometrical environment with an infinite number of symmetries . . . suggesting the "loop" resides on some

sort of negative-curvature surface. For the incomparably stable soliton waves which are deployed within

such negatively curved arenas also are just about the only concrete wave-forms which meet the "infinite

symmetries" (usually interpreted as "infinite number of conservation laws") requirement.

         Returning to our "to-do" list, tabulating the remaining complete lanyards in a box-kite is easy:

there are but two. First, any five Assessors form a pyramid atop a Tray-Rack. The pyramid's apex will

have two links marked with - 's leading to "beads" bounding one of the similarly marked edges of the

Tray-Rack, forming a triple zigzag; the other two "beads" of the Tray-Rack will be linked to the apex by

+'s, completing three trefoils. Avoiding one of the minus-marked edges (it doesn't matter which) of the

Tray-Rack, via detours through the apex, two such <U+00BE>-circuits of the Tray-Rack will yield a complete 10-

cycle lanyard.

         The second complete lanyard, as adumbrated earlier, is the box-kite itself. Pick one of the Tray-

Racks, and call its plane horizontal. Move along the side marked minus which forms a trefoil with the ver-

tical strut's upper Assessor. Mark the start and end points D1 and U2. Next, move up to the apex (the path

is marked plus) and keep tracing the vertical strut's Tray-Rack edges (landing next on the node diagonally

opposite U2 in the horizontal Tray-Rack) until you reach the vertical strut's lower member: U3, D4, D5.

Return to the same Assessor (but opposite diagonal) you started with: mark it U6. Now, follow the plus-

marked edge, circuiting the horizontal Tray-Rack until you reach the far end of the first leg of the journey:

U7, D8, D9. Return to the upper Assessor of the vertical strut (D10), then trace out three edges of the third

Tray-Rack (perpendicular to the two already traced): U11, U12, and D1 completes the cycle.

         Take the two ends of the vertical strut, and join them to any edge in the horizontal Tray-Rack.

Two combinations of sail-to-vent "butterflies" are possible: both triads are trefoils, or one is a triple zig-

zag. In the first case, the behavior is the UUDD 4-cycle we've already seen in the Tray-Rack; in the latter



                                                     Page 35
 case, we still get a 4-cycle, but along a different path: UUUD (or DDDU). What we have, then, in all three

distinct lanyards just examined, is the predominant role of a 3 + 1 logic, itself devolving upon the 3 trefoils

per triple-zigzag linkage structure which spurred thoughts about lanyards in the first place.

         What this suggests, in turn, is the guiding hand, not of G2 , but of the Klein Group - the unsigned

signature of the Quaternions, running things by remote control from the 8-Ball. And this, finally, points to

another "A-D-E"-based strategy, focused on D4 , which underwrites the 4-D "closest packing" pattern of the

24 unit Quaternions - and also explains what might be called the "virtual geometry" of the trefoils and zig-

zags, whose cross-over patterns underpin box-kites. For if continuous curves are generated according to

these patterns, we get diffeomorphisms of roulette curves (one from rolling an internal, the other an ex-

ternal, circle about another) which are the respective signatures of the Elliptic and Hyperbolic Umbilics.

         These oddly named entities designate singularities in Catastrophe Theory, where A-D-E reared its

head as a "Problem" in the first place. The former ("E.U.") traces a 3-cusped "control-plane" figure - a

cone based on a hypocycloid where the containing circle's radius is thrice the contained - while the latter

("H.U.") traces but one cusp, generated epicycloidally. Ditto, for the lobe counts of their hypo- and epi-

trochoidal "behavior-plane" mappings, the former just the trefoil by another name. As Arnol'd was the

first to demonstrate, these two forms of type D4 are the same in 4 complex dimensions, but split into two

distinct entities in 4-D real projection.

         Abstractly, the Clifford algebra reading would relate the 3:1 trefoil-to-zigzag ratio to the "grading"
                                                                    3

mial terms attaching to these coefficients yielding the "interpretation" rendered above: x , x y, xy , y can

be read as saying "1 zigzag and 3 trefoil sails, 3 trefoil and 1zigzag vents," with x vs. y tied to the inverse

"+,-" signing of strut-end links to each other Assessor. In the Catastrophist reading, these same monomi-

als, via "Groebner bases" formalism and the symmetry of x,y interchangeability, are necessary and suf-

                                                                                               2       3

                                                   3     3                                             3       2
generally, with H.U. ("D+4 ") most often written x + y , and E.U. ("D-4 ") usually presented as x - 3xy .

         These formal arguments will be given dynamic content later; for now, we still have much in the

way of naturalistic description to accomplish. First off, our inventory of complete lanyards is done, but that



                                                       Page 36
 of incomplete ones is unfinished. The full box-kite can be neatly partitioned into two halves, in two differ-

ent ways, analogous to the distinct half-complete lanyards of the Tray-Rack.

         First, looking at the lanyard diagram presented earlier, it's evident we can circuit its perimeter in

an "oom-pah-pah" 6-cycle - a pattern, for rhythmic reasons, we might call a "Waltz Band," and wonder

about the dynamic patterns of resonance between its two (UUDUUD, DDUDDU) modes. Secondly, we

can navigate a circuit suggesting a "Cat's Cradle," moving only along +-signed paths. We merely go round

a Tray-Rack, avoiding minus-signed edges by going up to and down from the strut orthogonal to the Tray-

Rack, to get to the other +-signed side. (After which, we go down to and up from the lower Assessor on the

strut, returning us to our starting point.) The "Cat's Cradle," too, has two modes: all U's or all D's.

         And what if we attempt to do something analogous with minus-only edges? The triple-zigzags are

disjoint, so there is no way to do so. What we can do, though, is string all 6 beads in one zigzag, and then -

instead of "closing the clasp" by completing the circuit - we take a +-signed journey to the other zigzag

and string all 6 of its beads. The result is a complete 12-bead strand with no clasp: closure in the sense a

group theorist would approve would require that familiar notion from spinor theory, double covering. (For

completeness' sake, I mention there is one other odd lanyard I'll call the "Missing Link," which covers all

but one bead among the Assessors it visits: the reader is invited to discover it.)

         The foremost feature of interest we have yet to investigate is Assessor composition, mandated by

struts in two senses. First, precisely because Assessors at opposite ends of a strut cannot co-produce zeros,

they can each contribute one or the other diagonal's pair of imaginary units into one 4-term ensemble. But

this ensemble must zero-divide both strut-pairs of neighboring Assessors (since each zero-divides these

individually), as well as their similarly built ensembles. Must, because any pair of struts necessarily span a

Tray-Rack, each corner of which forms a Co-Assessor trio with its immediate neighbors. But it gets worse

(or better) than this: for any strut's Assessors form trios with all four other Assessors in their box-kite.

This implies the existence of hyperplanes of up to four dimensions, each point of which zero-divides each

point in another of two. The maximal, 4-D, ones will be called "Seinfeld hyperplanes."

         Use the shorthand ( A, + ) to stand for an Assessor of type ( o + S ), and (F, - ) for ( o - S ).

Assume lanyard path-signing consistent with the letter scheme of the earlier box-kite diagram, and let

lower-case letters stand for real scalar values. We then get these possibilities for each box-kite.

 1.   Lines zero-dividing strut planes: It's readily checked that composites made from strut Assessors with

     the same orientation zero-divide nothing, since the signs on the lanyard diagram from each to any of

     the other four Assessors are always opposite. Take, then, as typical of oppositely oriented generators

     of a strut plane this expression: m( A, + ) + n( F, - ). All such points zero-divide ( B, - ) or ( C, - );

     or, ( D, + ) or ( E, + ). This gives 2 orientations x 3 struts x 4 Assessor choices = 24 ways.

2.   Lines zero-dividing mismatched-edge planes: For a given Tray-Rack, bounding either +-marked edge,

     take as typical the mismatch p( B, + ) + q( D, - ). All such points zero-divide either ( A, - ) or ( F, + ).

     2 orientations x 2 edges x 2 choices per orthogonal strut x 3 Tray-Racks = 24 ways. For either edge

     marked minus, take as typical the mismatch p( B, + ) + r( C, + ). All such points likewise zero-divide

     either ( A, - ) or ( F, + ), yielding the same count of 24 ways.

3.   Strut planes zero-dividing mismatched-edge planes: Take as typical m( A, + ) + n( F, - ), which zero-

     divides p( B, - ) + r( C, - ) and s( D, + ) + t( E, + ). 2 orientations x 2 choices x 3 struts = 12 ways.

4.   Strut planes zero-dividing strut planes: Take as typical m( A, + ) + n( F, - ), which zero-divides either

     p( B, - ) + t( E, + ) or r( C, - ) + s( D, + ). 2 orientations x 3 ways to pick pairs = 6 ways.

5.   Triple product of three strut planes: 2 ways by orientation, but as the path joining B to C is signed

     plus, and that joining D to E is minus, the two struts just listed as zero-dividing the first cannot zero-

     divide each other without a change in orientation: we have, then, a 6-cycle trefoil- or zigzag-like

     relation between these three planes, which indicates there is in fact but one way to obtain this result.

6.   Lines zero-dividing "tangled triad" solid: Either member from the strut in Case #1 zero-divides any

     picking of 3 Assessors from the 4 choices listed there. 2 orientations x 2 strut members x 3 struts x 4

     ways to pick 3 from 4 = 48 ways.

7.   Strut planes zero-dividing "tangled triad" solid: Use both strut members in the prior case instead of

     one or the other. 2 orientations x 3 struts x 4 ways to pick 3 from 4 = 24 ways.

8.   Lines zero-dividing 4-space: Only a pair of strut planes can span a 4-space, leaving two candidates for

     the line. 2 orientations x 3 ways to pick 2 struts x 2 candidates = 12 ways.




                                                       Page 38
 9.   Strut plane zero-dividing 4-space: Same choices as in Case #2, except that one of the 3 strut planes is

     seen as zero-dividing the 4-space spanned by the others. 2 orientations x 3 ways to pick which strut

     plane to leave out of the 4-space = 6 ways.



     The last and ninth case subsumes all others. And as there are 7 box-kites, there are therefore 42 Sein-

feld hyperplanes - the same as the number of Assessors, to which they can be uniquely mapped, in 2 ways.

(The strut plane which zero-divides the Seinfeld hyperplane must have, as we saw in Case #1, one of its

Assessors in "up" mode, and one in "down." The strut plane being uniquely forced, identifying the Sein-

feld hyperplane with one mode or the other is tantamount to specifying the Assessor.)

     If Case #9 subsumes all others, Case #5 - the 3-strut "triple product" - is their generator. This twist-

ing of planes through a 6-cycle underwrites the whole "Show About Nothing" for a given box-kite. With

each step along this complete lanyard, a different Seinfeld hyperplane is effectively addressed and made

accessible. More than this, Production Rule #2 can be globalized in a special manner that allows each box-

kite's "triple product" to communicate with each other. To see this clearly, we revert to concretizing via

Box-Kite III, and consider how best to annotate these processes.

     A strut which can work in a triple product has its Assessors in opposite orientations. Write one in par-

entheses as ( o + S ), and join it with a '+' to its partner, written ( o - S ). As a convention, since the strut

signature of Box-Kite III is 3, order each strut's two o's according to their cyclic order in the O-trip begin-

ning with 3, then order the three struts in ascending order of leading o's. The O-trips, recall, are ( 3, 1, 2 );

( 3, 4, 7 ); ( 3, 6, 5 ). These considerations, plus lanyard signing, lead to writing the 6-cycle this way:



         ( 1 + 10 ) + ( 2 - 9 ) <U+00E8> ( 4 - 15 ) + ( 7 + 12 ) <U+00E8> ( 6 + 13 ) + ( 5 - 14 ) <U+00E8>

         ( 1 - 10 ) + ( 2 + 9 ) <U+00E8> ( 4 + 15 ) + ( 7 - 12 ) <U+00E8> ( 6 - 13 ) + ( 5 + 14 ) <U+00E8>



         It's readily checked from the tables that each parenthetical term to the left of an arrow zero-divides

both such terms to the right. It's also obvious that arbitrary scalar values, of arbitrary sign, could be attach-

ed to the left of each such parenthetical dyad without affecting the zero result of any such "arrow product,"

thereby confirming it is planes we are dealing with. It's clear, too, that our convention for writing down




                                                      Page 39
 the 6-cycle makes it seem to be a triple-zigzag. However, a moment of juggling terms will convince one

that other conventions of ordering terms within struts, and struts within arrows, will produce all the zeros

required, while seeming to follow the signing of a trefoil - or even, of the impossible ( +, +, + ) cycle!

         This clash of allowable conventions has other side-effects of interest: our "strut signature cycle-

ordering" protocol, for starters, also induces the left-parenthesized o terms on either side of an arrow to

have opposite orientation in their O-trip from the right-parenthesized o's. 1 x 4 <U+00E8> + 5, but 2 x 7 <U+00E8> - 5;

for the 2nd and 5th arrows, 4 x 6 <U+00E8> 2, but 7 x 5 <U+00E8> - 2; for the 3rd and 6th , 6 x 1 <U+00E8> 7, but 5 x 2 <U+00E8> - 7.

         However, this side-effect is more general than that, in two senses. First, put the strut signature "3"

at the top of the standard projective PSL(2,7) triangle, and extend three rays down from it - one for each O-

trip which has a "3" in it - but put them in left-to-right order in any of the six possible ways, not just in the

ascending sequence of second indices per "strut signature cycle-ordering." The same effect obtains.

         Proof. Consider the triangle as a graph of directed arrows. The "effect" can then be seen this

way: the arrows between the second indices in the 3 rays flow coherently, in the sense that the arrows form

a reversal-free loop, as if they were an O-trip. But the arrows of the third indices in the 3 rays also flow

coherently - and are, in fact, an O-trip, but with reverse clockwise sense. Thus, the segment-to-segment

mapping of the effect in question will always show arrows with reverse directions. This effect is clearly

invariant under mirror reflection along the vertical axis of the triangle (i.e., the middle O-trip ray extending

from the top). But the six possible orderings of the rays break into two sets of 3, each set of which main-

tains the directions of all arrows in the triangle, with one set the mirror image of the other.

         But the side-effect is more general in a second sense. The pair of mirror-symmetric directed

graphs just discussed are not tied to a particular strut-signature's extended rays, but emerge with similar ray

extensions made from any of the seven indices which can sit on the nodes of the graph. They are, that is, a

side-effect - a kind of signature, in fact - of the initial choice of O-trip designations and orientations from

among the 480 possible (or, more precisely, of the smaller subset which require O-trip products adhere to

the XOR rule). This follows from the fact that none of the points or lines in the triangle is distinguished

from the rest, so moving an index to a different node without altering product structure maintains the orien-

tation of all arrows. (Other indices will invariably also shift nodes, but that is irrelevant to our argument.)

Such moves are just order-7 automorphisms, by a kind of "central rotation" acting transitively on all the




                                                      Page 40
 plane's point and line sets. (Other ways of displaying the relations of the Fano plane make this more visu-

ally obvious than does the PSL(2,7) triangle representation: see Polster, cited earlier.)

         The reason for belaboring the point? The Twist of Production Rule #2 can be applied twice (once

to each dyad) to each strut pair. But the difference in orientation just demonstrated demands the two appli-

cations be performed in correspondingly different senses. Moreover, by showing the process concretely for

Box-Kite III, we will be demonstrating it, thanks to the proven effect, for all box-kites at once. What we're

about to display and justify can be thought of as either a peculiar sort of product structure, or as an algorith-

mic procedure for taking a "Knight's Tour" of the zero-divisor structure of Sedenion space. As the tandem

applications of Production Rule #2, and the ways their results are recombined into strut pairs of all other

box-kites, are highly suggestive of the ways genetic material is split and remixed during fertilization, this

process is called the "recombinant divisor-navigation algorithm," or "recombinant DNA" for short.

         Take two consecutive terms in the strut-product 6-cycle, writing one above the other, and accord-

ing to "strut signature cycle-ordering" protocol. Twist the dyads in each of the two columns in the same

sense - for convention's sake, let's say flip the sign of the bottom dyad's Sedenion after moving it to the

top dyad, while the sign of the top dyad's Sedenion is left unchanged after relocating. Then, collect the

resulting dyads crosswise - the left bottom dyad to the top right, the left top to the bottom right. The result

is a pair of struts (the third obtainable by Production Rule #1) for the Box-Kite whose strut signature is the

XOR of (either pair of) diagonally opposite Octonion units in the two lines being twisted.

         Now, twist the diagonally opposite dyads in the two struts, in opposite senses - for convention's

sake, let's say twist the top-left and bottom-right dyads so that the bottom dyad's Sedenion sign is flipped

after moving to the top left. But twist the bottom-left and top-right dyads so that the top dyad's Sedenion

sign is flipped after moving to the bottom left. The result is a pair of struts for the Box-Kite whose strut

signature is the XOR of (either pair of) the same-column Octonion units in the two lines being twisted.

         The three struts in a Box-Kite each have two distinct Octonion units which do not appear in the

others. Pairs of these, formed one from each strut pairing, generate two distinct XOR products. When the

"recombinant DNA" procedure is performed on three consecutive pairings of struts in their 6-cycle, these

distinct XORings therefore produce the strut signatures for all 6 other Box-Kites. The group-theorist's (or

chess puzzler's) dream of a complete "Knight's Tour" from any strut in any box-kite to any other (and




                                                     Page 41
 therefore from any Zero Divisor to any other) is thereby facilitated. Now let's see all this concretely,

operating on the consecutive strut-pairings of Box-Kite III.

         While looking at the schematic on the next page, contemplate the way its generality for all box-

kites was shown. As a proof, it is highly unsatisfying, relying on properties that are not very generic. The

pattern of arrow orientations seems accidental, and is not maintained by "isomorphism" in Moreno's sense.

Indeed, requiring one or more O-trips to remain fixed while we "rotate" the other lines, all without chang-

ing multiplication rules, means we're working with the 168 symmetries of PSL(2,7). But don't these

merely serve to screen out all but 30 symmetrically equivalent unsigned labelings from the 7! = 5040 that

are possible?

         The inability to come up with a "better" proof led to the discovery of some surprising "bad news":

equivalence of multiplication tables does not hold with Sedenions where zero-divisors are concerned. But

it also points the way toward understanding the mystery of the "Moreno counterfeits" with 2 mis -signed O-

trips we left hanging earlier: notions of equivalence beneath the multiplicative structure (and hence at the

level of "graphical flow patterns") are, in fact, non-trivial. (Otherwise, the equivalent count of elements in

PSL(2,7), henceforth "the Triangle," and the number of primitive unit zero-divisors in the Sedenions,

would be "pure coincidence" - and how frequently is that the case in mathematics?)

                                                Page 43
          Before becoming too attached to the prettiness of the above algorithmic pattern - providing, as it

does, a very nice generalization to the "composite zero-divisor" case, of the "Seinfeld production" mode of

interconnecting all primitive zero-divisors across box-kites -- mull the following fact. All but the simplest

"lanyard theory," not to mention "Recombinant DNA" navigational strategies, vanish if we switch to an

arbitrary, allegedly "equivalent" multiplication table by flipping signs on one or more units. The symmetry

of what lanyard diagrams we do get also breaks - and breaks in different ways for different box-kites. The

reader is encouraged to investigate the possibilities, and see what odd anomalies can be discovered: it is

not hard, for instance, to flip a few signs and get a table which generates box-kites with at least one for

which all Co-Assessor Trios are triple zigzags! (Try permuting signs on units indexed 3, 6, 5; or, try the

same with 10, 15, 12 instead. Then, using the tables provided above, look at Box Kite I in either case.)

         Abstractly, at least, this is not astonishing. It is known that the Cayley-Dickson process, for N > 3,
            N
generates 2 -ions which already suffer from a sign-flipping asymmetry of a more abstruse variety. The

iterative procedure used to create double-dimensioned extensions of the reals takes one parameter (always

+ 1 or 0) for each doubling, which parameter equals the square of a generating unit of the algebra. For N =

4, setting all 4 generators to the negative real unit creates the Sedenions we've been focused on. For N < 4,

setting one or more generators to the positive real unit creates various modes of "split" algebras, with units

some or all of whose squares (e.g., the Pauli spin matrices) can be +1, of clear utility in relativity theory.

As with the closely allied Clifford algebras (which include the results of the Cayley-Dickson process), the

order in which differently signed parameters are fed into the underlying algorithm makes no difference . . .

unless N > 4. In that case, as Lounesto (note 4, p. 287) points out, "in contrast to the Clifford algebras,

different orderings of the parameters . . . may result in non-isomorphic algebras".

         Coming closer to the ground, let's revert to the graphics lifted from Lohmus et al. earlier, and

consider the underlying projective geometry of the Sedenion triplet structure. Each doubling of dimension

is generated by the addition of a single point. All points are defined over the field of modulo-2 integers, so

lines between points can only have coordinates whose values are 1's and 0's, meaning no line can have

more than 3 points: (1,0) and (0,1) are joined by (1,1), for instance. The extra added point can hence be

thought of as a "bit to the left," so that the generator of the Octonions from the Quaternions is represented

by a 3-bit unit (1,0,0), while the generator of the Sedenions from the Octonions is (1,0,0,0): the "8-Ball."



                                                      Page 44
          By the built-in magic of projective spaces, we have dual structures: when considering projections

from N dimensions to the next dimension down, the number of points is the same as the number of (N-1)-

dimensional entities in the space, the number of lines equals the number of (N-2)-dimensioned things, and

so on. Hence, the Octonions have 7 points and 7 lines, and Sedenions have 15 points and 15 planes. With

the Octonions, there is a breakdown of algebraic symmetry manifesting in the loss of the associative pro-

perty. With the Sedenions - whose 15-D continuum can be considered as spanned by units represented by

the 15 points on the "projective tetrahedron" over the field of modulo-2 integers we saw before - there is a

breaking of geometric symmetry.       And it is manifested in the need to look beneath the usual Moreno-style

"isomorphism" level, to "flow structure" patterns like those utilized in the "bad proof" above. So let's give

these "not-worth-considering" properties a name, and investigate their workings.

         The 168-element simple group governing the symmetries of the Triangle can be decomposed in a

natural manner into 3 quite distinct subgroups, of which it is the product. The smallest - and, for immedi-

ate purposes, most significant - of these is the 4-element "Klein Group." It governs XORing among two-

bit binary strings, the rotations of a tetrahedron's altitudes into each other . . . and possible label-changes on

the Triangle when we keep an O-trip unpermuted and locked in place.

         Let's say (1 2 3 ) is on the bottom row of the Triangle, and our "identity element" labeling scheme

has 4 in the center, so that (1 7 6 ) runs up the left slope, and ( 6 5 3 ) runs down the right. Each of the 3

units in the fixed O-trip has two other O-trips running through it, and we get the other 3 elements of our

Klein group by "rotating" these pairs: with '1' as pivot, the median (1 4 5 ) is swapped with the left edge,

putting 7 in the middle, and 5 at the apex. Similarly, '2' as pivot interchanges the vertical and "circular"

lines' other terms, swapping 6 into the center and 4 to the apex, and making 5 and 7 exchange places. The

third rotation, with '3' as pivot, puts the 5 in the middle, and the left-slope midpoint, 7, at the apex.

         What we're interested in doing is freely swapping any of the 7 O-trips into the bottom row where

we've just put ( 1 2 3 ). This implies a 7-element cyclic group, which in turn requires the triangular dihed-

ral group be included, to allow for rotating the Triangle and/or reflecting through median lines - which,

combined with the Klein Group, has the side-effect of allowing any permutation of the "fixed" O-trip to

replace it in the "fixed" position. Now let's see why we're interested in this.




                                                      Page 45
          The labeling operation on the leftmost Identity Triangle which appears on the far right - the pro-

duct, in turn, of the two in the middle - is the scheme of arrows implicit in the "bad proof" conducted

above. Consider the "Identity" scheme, flush left: take any of the 7 O-trips, and arrange the Triangle's

labels so that the chosen O-trip sits on the bottom, with the arrows of the others arrayed as shown. We say

the new arrangement is "flowmorphic" to it. By using PSL(2,7)'s group operations, we can "rotate" any O-

trip into the bottom-most position, so that 7 such "flowmorphs" can be produced. That's just for Octonion

labelings: but recall our earlier observations concerning the "8-Ball," and you'll see that all labelings of

the Triangle with an O-trip at bottom and '8' in the middle are "flowmorphic" to our "Identity" scheme.

         For any S-trip ( o, 8, 8+o ) will have all arrows from any of the 3 o's through the '8' pointing to-

ward the pure Sedenion. The extra bit in the '8' has, meanwhile, no effect on the orientation of the remain-

ing 3 lines, since XORing will remove it between S's, and preserve it between an o and an S. The 7 O-trips

thereby generate 7 8-Ball-containing O-copies, all "flowmorphs" of the Octonions proper.

         When the mystery arose, we didn't yet know that all "O-copies" containing the 8-Ball could not

harbor zero-divisors. So we see that "flowmorphs" are not merely isomorphic in Moreno's sense, but also

include precisely and only those "Moreno isomorphs" which do not harbor zero-divisors. How to get the

converse - that copies of the Triangle which do harbor zero-divisors are not flowmorphic to the Octonions

proper or the septet of 8-Ball-holding Triangles in the PGL(4,2) Tetrahedron?

         Let's bring to mind a built-in asymmetry of the Octonion flow-system we're focused on: if we

circuit the Triangle labeled like our 8 flowmorphs, orientation along edges is not invariant, but reverses

either once or twice, depending upon the clockwise sense of one's circuiting. The Sedenion tetrahedron,

however, has rotational symmetry, which will conflict with the flow-system asymmetry of our 8 flow-

morphs, yielding the "2 signing conflicts" we cited as a computable fact (and unresolved mystery) earlier.




                                                    Page 46
          Proof. Consider the Octonions' Triangle to be the base of the tetrahedron, then consider the face

containing the (1 2 3) O-trip. But for this bottom-edge-spanning O-trip, all flow-lines on the face are S-

trips included in an 8-Ball-containing O-copy. The 3 flowmorphs incorporating the O-trips joining edge

midpoints to vertices in the base obviously include the 8-Ball in the center and the 12 at the top, so this

covers the face's 3 lines proceeding down from the apex to the 1, 2 and 3. Similarly, the two diagonal

flow-lines belong to the 2 flowmorphs incorporating the O-trips spanning the base's other two edges. Fi-

nally, the midpoint-cycle is derived from rotating the base's midpoint circle (2 5 7) onto an edge, putting

the 8-ball in the middle, and getting the face's midpoint-cycle as a same-way-oriented edge.

          Rotate the tetrahedron in the same sense as the (2 5 7) midpoint circle's arrow. This will cause

the midpoint circles in the 3 faces to mirror the orientation of the base's ( 2 5 7 ). But it will also induce a

cycling through the 3 flowmorphs straddling midpoint-to-vertex joins in the base. The flow-asymmetry of

the base, however, will cause one of the 3 flow-lines shared with the face (the rightmost edge, which points

down in flowmorphs) to reverse orientation, as the opposite, up-oriented, edge of the flowmorph is rotated

through it. Meanwhile, the same sequence of rotations will cause the 3 flowmorphs set on the base's edges

and with apices in face-edge midpoints to be cycled through, with the same result on the median descend-

ing to the '3' at bottom-right. And, since the midpoint-cycle is unaffected by the rotations, we get only 2

flow-lines with reversed orientation in the face. Lastly, we saw before that no flipping of signs on units can

bring the face into correspondence (and hence make it flowmorphic) with the Octonions' Triangle. By

symmetry, the same result obtains for all 3 faces attaching to the base, and (via rotations of the other lines

of the base to its edges) to the remaining 4 8-Ball-free triangles. Q.E.D.

          We can now see, too, that getting the same 2 lines to be mis -signed, no matter what inputs were

fed into Moreno's mapping machine, is a red herring: ( 3 4 7 ) and ( 3 6 5 ) are just the median and edge

which get reversed when ( 1 2 3 ) is the fixed O-trip in the "flowmorphic" labeling, and the Tetrahedron is

rotated per above . . . and recall that Moreno's mapping specified the association of this O-trip with its first

three outputs!

                                      *        *         *         *         *

          It would be easy to dwell on the last few pages' analysis and assume a negative attitude. Yet not

many years ago, data later touted as evidence of Chaos Theory's ubiquity was regularly tossed out by

experimentalists as proof a test had gone awry and needed redoing. In other arenas, finding - as we've just

done by spinning the projective tetrahedron - that internal symmetries are injected into the behaviors you

thought them insulated from, would be cause for celebration. The theory of "composed maps" in the early

history of Catastrophe Theory, for instance, was built upon just such sought-for phenomena, which were

sought precisely because their mathematics gave promise of mimicking the fundamental life processes of

morphogenesis, where the "internal symmetries," of course, are harbored in the DNA.

         In the early days of quantum theory, Niels Bohr's "Light and Life" and Erwin Schrodinger's

"What Is Life?" inspired a generation of physicists to migrate to molecular biology. In our own day, some

two generations after Watson and Crick, the new theory of quantum computation is leading to a rethinking

about the bases of life processes that promises to inspire a second great migration. A paper delivered in the

first fortnight of the new Millennium, and not yet in print (but downloadable from the Internet) as I write

this, can be taken as a harbinger of such a shift. In "Quantum Algorithms and the Genetic Code"[15],

Apoorva Patel identifies components of DNA structure which implement Grover's algorithm of quantum

search, proposing a key role for enzymes in maintaining the quantum coherence of the process. The view

of DNA replication and protein synthesis he conjures culminates in a spectacular explanation for "why

living organisms have 4 nucleotide bases and 20 amino acids": he writes, "It is amazing that these numbers

arise as solutions to an optimization problem" - especially an optimization of a quantum algorithm!

         What results like these and, more critically, the mind-sets which can generate them, should sug-

gest to us is this: the usual assessment of "negative results" in studying hypercomplex numbers may

require some standing on its head. Recast the problem as related to the workings of life itself, and things

look somewhat different. Think of high-energy physics as cast in the image of life processes instead of the

other way, and things seem more different still.

         Imagine the Cayley-Dickson process as analogous to mitosis, with Sedenions representing some-

thing akin to the fourth bifurcation of a fertilized egg. The collapse of the equivalence of multiplication

tables then appears as an eminently sensible defensive strategy, put in place to protect the budding embryo

from external invaders: it takes on the trappings, that is, of an immune system response.




                                                    Page 48
          Without the "open sesame" of the right "keycode," isolating the lettering scheme in actual use

becomes a needle-in-haystack quest. With the code, though, navigability via "recombinant DNA" tactics,

or the earlier-discussed combination of box-kite dynamics and Twist products, allows for "making some-

thing out of nothing" in ways we've yet to fathom. What we have described herein is not likely to mark the

end of the utility of "dimension doubling" in number theory; quite probably, it merely points the way past

slow beginnings.



{ IV }   Heuristic Afterthoughts on Dynamic Possibilities:

         From the viewpoint of specialists, the realms of Lie-algebraic gauge theory and stably unfolded

singularities would seem totally unrelated. Naively, however, the study of zero-divisors (arising most

"naturally" in the space of Sedenions, where the Dirac Equation lives) cannot be too far removed from the

study of the "zeros" of ensembles of polynomials. Philosophically, too, the only author to write major texts

on both the Lie and Catastrophe theories, Robert Gilmore, finds it necessary to insert a singularity substrate

beneath the smooth surface of symmetries that obsesses contemporary physicists:

         There is nothing spontaneous about symmetry breaking. It is a consequence of some
         dynamics or some variational principle. The word "spontaneous" is a smokescreen
         behind which hides a vast ignorance of the nonlinear mathematics which ultimately
         provides a description for the physical processes at hand. It is this nonlinear mathematics
         which is of central importance. The presence of symmetries allows higher catastrophes
         to occur at the cost of fewer control parameters. Many different symmetries may play the
         same restrictive role for a given nonlinear dynamics. The nonlinear mathematics is
         central, symmetry peripheral. Symmetry exists to be broken. To regard "spontaneous
         symmetry breaking" as the driving force behind some physical process is to miss entirely
         that physical process. ( Reference 6, p. 462 )

         A triptych of figures sits immediately above the quoted passage in Gilmore's text, illustrating a

sequence of phase transitions physicists often call the "Mexican hat": a parabolic bowl is poised mouth up

at time zero; in the second snapshot, its bottom begins to flatten out against some plane of resistance; in the

final panel, the central region where flattening has concentrated dimples up, yielding the overall contour of

a sombrero. (Put metastable "false vacuum" atop its crown, "true vacuum" in the brim-rimmed trough.)

         To the Catastrophist, this same set of figures signifies something apparently quite different from

Higgs mechanisms governing mass's emergence from the Void. The initial picture implies a two-dimen-

                     2    2
sional potential V = x + y , and its squashing suggests a destabilizing perturbation, the smooth unfolding




                                                   Page 49
 of whose effects requires a "figure of regulation" organizing the action of nonlinear "controls" on the two

"behaviors" x and y. By a fairly exact analogy to the linear situation, where force is proportional to accel-

eration, the "frictional" effects of higher-order terms start at two derivatives' distance from the potential in

question. "Siersma's Trick" provides a remarkably simple picture: monomials making up a regulatory

ensemble or "germ" are pinpointed on Pascal's Triangle, with those in their "shadow" at two or more deri-

vatives' remove comprising the "harmonics" being damped or amplified by "controls." For the case at

                                                                              4      4
hand, the "germ terms" at two steps from the "behavior" at the onset are x and y ; the (nine) controls,

                                                                                              2       2
then, reside in the 3 x 3 rhombus whose corners are the real unit at the apex ("line zero"), x and y at the

                           2 2
ends of line two, and the x y pendant at the center of the fourth line, of the Triangle.

         From the topologist's vantage, one of these controls is trivial (the real unit), and one is quite spe-

cial (the fourth-order term). Usually called, instead, a "parameter," this nonlinear term is special because

of the peculiar invariance it underwrites. If four lines are allowed to intersect each other in an arbitrary

manner (are put in "general position") in the x,y plane, the most general algebraic representation of their

situation involves the product of four terms of type ax + by, while their most general geometric characteri-

zation would pinpoint the projective invariance of the "cross-ratio" determined by four such lines. (That

is, the smooth navigation between all possible "points of view" on a scene - most concretely realized in

aerial reconnaissance photography, where readily fixed signposts like railroad tracks serve to anchor the

measurements - depends upon the unchanging pattern of proportionality between any four points - or, by

projective-geometric "duality," four lines - being viewed from various perspectives.)

         What makes this "special" is the context in which it first emerged into view: half a century ago,

Milnor and Kervair found, in 8-D and up, that manifolds could be homeomorphic yet not diffeomorphic

(i.e., transformable into each other by "rubber sheet geometry," but at the cost of loss of "smooth transi-

tions" in their dynamic descriptions). This seemed baffling at the time, but has since become almost tame:

viewed in other contexts, kindred phenomena are readily grasped - may even, in fact, seem "obvious."

         At the beginnings of perspective geometry itself, for instance, the great mystic, church leader, and

mathematical visionary, Nicholas of Cusa, exploited the illusory effect of the newfangled "trompe d'oeil"

painting in an inspirational discourse offered to the inhabitants of a monastery. The eyes of the painting, he

said, like the "Vision of God" (his lecture's title), seem to follow you, no matter where you stand in relation


                                                     Page 50
 to them. If you let your ego delude you, you may come to think that God has singled you out and succumb

to spiritual inflation; if you transcend this snare, however, you will get a glimpse of the higher truth that all

may singly feel His gaze upon them in just the same manner, hence implying the omnivoyance of the

Creator. (This illusion is now so well-known as to be a clich<U+00E9>, and is entertainingly discussed, bereft of all

metaphysics, in a page of Steinhaus' delightful classic, "Mathematical Snapshots"; but in Cusa's day, its

effect was a novelty - and a mystery - of a very high degree.)

         In modern parlance, students of Chaos, Artificial Life, and systems far from equilibrium speak not

of God's Omnivoyance, but of Order's "self-emergence": consider, for instance, the multitude of indivi-

dual cellular beings who can combine to form the fruiting body of that singular entity we call a slime mold

(an example favored by both systems theorist Ilya Prigogine[16] and catastrophist E. C. Zeeman[17]).

And, instead of the "trompe d'oeil" painting, we could just hand somebody a three-mirror prismatic kalei-

doscope. Unlike the ubiquitous, hexagonally-symmetric, two-mirror scopes every child knows, the three-

mirror prismatic kind display an infinite number of centers of symmetry, not just one. Likewise, the

Double Cusp Catastrophe (the two-potential kindred of the "sombrero" surface introduced above) can be

viewed as having an infinite number of germinal centers - one for each distinct value of its "parameter."

         In certain applications, this parameter can be treated as delimiting, for a small range of values at

either side of its zero, a "sweet spot" within whose confines certain optimal transformations are possible

which are otherwise unavailable. For "almost all" parameter values, "sweet" or not, oscillations and trans-

formations between a very small number of stable regimes are possible (no more than five, in fact). But for

the two critical values of the "parameter" which bound the "sweet spot," control breaks down utterly, and

chaos (in the guise of an infinite-dimensional "control space") can ensue. This can, in fact, happen in the

"real world": square sea-going vessels built with vertical sides all the way round, like floating oil-rig

platforms which haven't yet been moored to the ocean's bottom, can be rendered violently unstable by

small perturbations of wind and wave[18].

                    4   4    2 2
         When x + y + Kx y has parameter K = +2, this ensemble can be factored into the "squared

         2    2 2
circle" (x + y ) . Then, instead of the figure of regulation displaying a simple polygonal symmetry (most

commonly, the fourfold variety inspiring this unfolding's "Double Cusp" name), we get the limit of n-gonal

symmetry as n tends toward infinity: the circular troughing, that is, of the "Mexican hat" dynamics. When,



                                                     Page 51
 further, this general mode of unfolding is subjected to various constraints (most notably, the bilateral sym-

metry which controls the morphogenesis of most complex living things), the parameter can optimally take

values outside the "sweet spot" - thereby guaranteeing a "Mexican hat" phase transition if the constraints

are somehow suddenly relaxed, leading the untrammeled dynamic to then home in on the "sweet spot."

         The possibilities just alluded to in the last paragraph can be extremely subtle, and are still not

completely understood by singularity theorists. What the theorists do have a thorough grasp of, however,

are the taxonomical categories: all the types of "parameter"-containing singularities (although not their

detailed behaviors) have been determined up to very high dimension. And, not surprisingly, the method of

their determination is a straightforward extension of the "A-D-E" logic whose cross-disciplinary ubiquity

first emerged in the classificatory study of the parameter-free, "elementary" catastrophes.

         Let's take the simple-minded view: for "parameter-free" catastrophes, the catalog embraces ana-

logs of n-sided polygons (short-hand: A n ), their flippable siblings (the D series, "D" for "dihedral), and a

finite set of three exceptional 3-D templates, the so-called Platonic solids (the E series, "E" for "exception-

al" or "Euclidean," depending on taste). Meanwhile, thanks to the magic of the "A-D-E Problem," the

three major division algebras can be correlated with one instance of each letter: A 2 for Imaginaries, D4 for

Quaternions, E8 for Octonions. The collapse of division algebras is thereby correlated with the emergence

of "parameters" and non-elementary catastrophes. Might not their "extended Dynkin diagram" logic,

therefore, provide highly qualified candidates for ferreting out the secrets of zero-divisor arithmetics?

         In the heart of Plato's Timaeus, a mathematical creation myth would spawn the building blocks of

matter from the "ideal" polyhedra, but would generate these, in their turn, from three mysterious triangles.

It is these which are the templates for the non-elementary catastrophes, as well - and, by "extended A-D-E"

logic, for the three varieties of three-mirror prismatic kaleidoscopes also. Each "Timaeus triangle" pro-

vides the template for an infinite series of higher-order forms[19]. They can be "read off" as follows.

         The singularity theorist, as if he were taking the famed analogy of "Plato's Cave" literally,

determines the fundamental characteristics of his quarry in the Imaginary realm, and then projects down

from complex space to our "shadow" realm of "real" solutions. As the great experimentalist, Sir David

Brewster, knew soon after inventing the kaleidoscope, easy geometric arguments give only three kinds of

three-mirror prismatics (and one with four mirrors which, for reasons that will be implicit in what follows,


                                                     Page 52
 are of little interest to singularity theorists, since all the mirrors are at right angles)[20]. And, as his con-

temporaries were the first to fathom, angles are naturally interpreted as exponents in the complex plane.

            The Timaeus Triangles, then, are readily grasped as involving three behavior variables, the com-

ponent of the germ specific to each being raised to the power of the aliquot part of the semicircle indicated

when putting the mirrors in place to make the prism. The equilateral triangle then leads to writing a "germ
        3      3     3
term" X + Y + Z , which (by the extension of "Siersma's Trick" to Pascal's Tetrahedron) has six controls

(operating on X, Y, Z, and XY, YZ, and ZX) and one parameter (the XYZ monomial). The isosceles right

                                                   4    4     2                                         2
triangle (the Double Cusp) is written thus: X + Y + Z (effectively two behaviors, as the Z part of the

term can have only linear - and hence, trivial - unfolding). Finally, the 30-60-90 triangle is written as just
 6     3      2                                                                     2 2
X + Y + Z , with parameter of the same form as with the Double Cusp: X Y .

            These three are respectively shorthanded as P8 , X9 , and R10 , with two less than the index indicat-

ing the number of controls. When treated as the instantiating "starter kit" for making an infinite number of

higher-order forms, they are shorthanded T3,3,3 , T2,4,4 and T2,3,6 in that order. We might consider the "T"

to stand for "toroidal," since the polycentric nature of these singularities' unfoldings - like the invariant

symmetric figure used to "wallpaper" the layout of their kaleidoscopes' ever-changing visuals - is obvious-

ly generated by a torus-map built using the appropriate Timaeus Triangle as template. (Brewster didn't use

such terminology, far less that of elliptic function theory, but his pictures and geometric preliminaries con-

vey this message quite readily to the mathematically attuned modern reader.)

            Now the question of moment is how all this relates to the theory of zero-divisors in Sedenion

space; the harbinger of the answer can be found in the study of "alcoves" which emerges in Tits' theory of

buildings. Here, not the root structure proper, but the Weyl groups of its associated system of affine reflec-

tions, are germane. In a classic text on Coxeter theory, James E. Humphreys introduces alcoves with a

telling example: if the affine Weyl group has rank 2, the associated alcoves "are triangles with angles <U+03C0> / k,

<U+03C0> / l, <U+03C0> / m, where (k,l,m) = (3,3,3), (2,4,4), (2,3,6), in the respective cases A 2 , B2 , G2 ."[21] In other words,

when moving from standard root-structure interpretation to the associated infinite-dimensional affine

system, an exact correspondence is found between the simplest "non-elementary" catastrophes and the

simplest non-trivial Coxeter-Dynkin diagrams - including Guillermo Moreno's favorite G2 !

 The Timaeus Tesselations (a.k.a. Brewster's Prismatics)




                        Page 54
          G2 can also be construed as a singularity, either under symmetric constraint, or on the boundary of

a manifold (Reference 19, pp. 278-80, where line 9 of the last page should refer to Section 17.3). Cast in

this manner, the geometry of the germ bears a close affinity to the context of Co-Assessor Trios' toroidal

"ping-pong dynamics" briefly touched upon much earlier. For now, we take some smaller steps toward a

zero-divisor interpretation of Double Cusp dynamics. The reader is referred back to the graphic of the

"Duncan donut" torus map, as the "accident" of its correspondence to the standard "extended Dynkin

diagram" for the Double Cusp (four isosceles right triangles making a box) will be our starting point.

         How could a torus map like this relate to forms of number? Considering how will take us back to

the simpler (or at least, non-Sedenion) context of the 8-D Clifford algebra usually shorthanded Cl(3), and

containing the Quaternions, three "Counter-Quaternion" units which are non-real square roots of positive

unity ("double numbers" in the literature[22]), and an imaginary unit which commutes with all the above.

         Introduced algebraically by W. K. Clifford, the Italian geometer Corrado Segr<U+00E9> was the first to

study the geometry of the number forms required by such a "double" unit. He showed its continuum of

powers entails a 4-space with 1 real and 2 imaginary axes, plus one for the "double" unit itself; and, that

this latter's orbit consists of two orthogonal circles centered on (mutually zero-dividing) idempotent points,

passing respectively through the "double-unit" axis at <U+00B1>1, and meeting in the real unit. Implicit is a kind of

exponentiation defined on all points of the 2-torus "doughnut," so that its 4-space (like that of Penrose's

twistor construct) is isomorphic to the product space of two standard complex circles[23].

         Segr<U+00E9>'s work was long gathering dust when Charles Mus<U+00E8>s[24] independently arrived at a more

modern-looking formulation, which explicitly referenced Pauli spin matrices and the operator language of

the quantum-mechanical toolkit, all recast into so-called "hypernumber" forms. Mus<U+00E8>s also created an

extrapolation of Octonions to 16-D, including spin-matrix analogs of the 7 imaginary units, plus the com-

mutative imaginary now familiar in Clifford-algebra texts, but quite unusual in the physics literature of the

late 60's to early 80's, when Mus<U+00E8>s wrote the bulk of his papers. This 16-D "M-algebra" has the basic

structure of the superstring theorists' E8 x E8 , and so was quite prophetic of things to come a decade later.

Ironically, though, the advent of theoretical approaches portended by his own led to Mus<U+00E8>s' own work

falling by the wayside in mainstream research. (But Tony Smith's website has recently resurrected this rich

vein of pioneering work, which the reader is encouraged to explore.)

         We consider, first, the basic 4-D spin-matrix geometry. It conforms to the X + Y + Z form of

the Double Cusp's "Timaeus Triangle," as it: (1) is spanned by two imaginary units (period 4) and one

spin unit (period 2); and, (2) has all orbits on a 2-torus. But the connection cuts deeper still. Before we can

elicit it, however, we'll need a quick boil-down of Mus<U+00E8>s' notation and most basic results.

         Using the Greek lower-case epsilon (e) for his spin units, and the usual i for imaginaries, he uses

the subscript 0 to signify respectively the real unit and the "commutative i," while the subscripts 1 - 3

signify the standard Quaternion 2x2 matrices, and spin units which are equal to the same-indexed Quarter-

nion with each of its matrix entries multiplied by the negative of the usual imaginary unit. This gives

                  ek <U+00B7> ik = ik <U+00B7> ek = i0,          ek <U+00B7> i0 = i0 <U+00B7> ek = ik,              ik <U+00B7> i0 = i0 <U+00B7> ik = (- ek )

         For ik , ek , 4 < k < 7, 2x2 matrix representations are not possible, since Octonions are in general not

associative; however, by constructing so-called "bi-matrices" Mus<U+00E8>s extends his e-numbers to provide a

full "counter-complex" complement to the Octonions in his 16-D "M-Algebra." The indexing rules are

identical to those for Octonions, so that i0 commutes among same-indexed units in this context also. Hence,

by the usual "associative triplets" rule combined with Mus<U+00E8>s' felicitous XORing of indices,

                  em <U+00B7> in = im <U+00B7> en = e[m xor n]   and          em <U+00B7> en = (- i[m xor n] )

         Mus<U+00E8>s' manner of writing his "hypernumber" version of de Moivre's Theorem is rather cumber-

some - in fact, he must write two separate equations, one for each circle attaching to <U+00B1>e. A much cleaner

and more elegant "Spin Control Equation" can be derived, relating the product of the circles to their sum:

                              (- e )K <U+00B7> (+ e )Q = (- e )K + (+ e )Q - 1

         If we set K (Q) constant, while letting Q (K) vary freely, each choice of the constant exponent

yields a circle, isometric and parallel to the spin orbit denoted by the varying exponent. Most obviously, if

the constant exponent be set to 0, we get one or the other spin-orbit circle; if the constant be set to <U+00B1>1, we

get circles parallel to the spin-orbit circles, but centered on the negative of the appropriate idempotent. For

some index m, if K and Q for (<U+00B1> em ) are equal in magnitude and similarly (oppositely) signed, we get i0 2K

( im2K ) - showing, again, the 4-cycle nature of the imaginaries to the spin-unit's 2-cycle. Numerous other

variations can be obtained by setting the exponents to be imaginary or spin-unit quantities, etc.




                                                          Page 56
          Returning now to the Double Cusp, it, like all the Catastrophes, is a stratified object: it is built up

entirely and only of simpler singularities, in the manner of a programmer's "object hierarchy." But as its

structure is dualistic, entailing a framework for resolving conflicts between two fields of behaviors, its

strata can be prepared from more than one point of view. And by containing a parameter (also called a

"modulus," so that this germ is often dubbed of "unimodular" type in the literature), we can be assured its

stratification has other subtleties as well. The key vantages are three:

         I: "Platonic sequence" -- Viewed collectively with P8 and R10 as support for the infinite T-

series, X9 is not only built upon a "Timaeus triangle," but contains a maximal two-behavior stratum which

is associated with one of the Platonic polyhedra. P8 contains E6 (hence, "tetrahedrality"); X9 contains E7

(and thereby the symmetry common to cube and octahedron); R10 houses E8 (the dodeca- and icosa- hedral

duals). Earlier, while briefly touching on the coming attractions of what we can find in the 32-D "Path-

ions," it was noted that the sum total of "Assessor"-like entities in each "hyper-box-kite" was 126 - the

number of roots in E7 . The suggestion is that this "Platonic" view of Double Cusp stratification, while

pointing to lower-dimensional forms in the Catastrophe context, points to higher (32-D) forms in Zero-

Divisor theory. Knowing nearly nothing about the latter, exploring this possibility must be deferred.

         II: "Umbilic sequence" -- In discussing lanyards, the germs of the elliptic and hyperbolic umbi-

lics ("EU" and "HU") were related to the monomials of the line of Pascal's Triangle that generated Cl(3),

with their attendant geometries being related, in their turn, to the trefoil/zigzag dichotomy. In a classic

study of "The Umbilic Bracelet," E. C. Zeeman[25] showed how a 3-cusped hypo- (or 1-cusped epi- )

cycloidal section could be used as the base of a cylinder which, with a 1/3 "twist," could have its two ends

joined together in a torus, with this "bracelet" providing a basis for the Double Cusp's stratification. If the

hypocycloid is used, all points inside the bracelet are EU's and all outside are HU's, and vice-versa for the

epicycloid. The "skin," in either case, is made up of "parabolic umbilic" points, whose germs unfold with

one more control than EU or HU, and contain them both as strata, in precisely the manner a tilting flash-

light intersects a wall in a parabola for one infinitesimal angle between its sweeping out of ellipses and

hyperbolae. The closed loop traced by the cusp edges, meanwhile, supports the higher "E6" stratum.




                                                     Page 57
 The umbilic bracelet's dual representations are shown at left. The HU's 1-cusped epi-, and the EU's 3-
cusped hypo-, cycloid sections are shown below. (From pp. 62-3, Poston & Stewart, Taylor Expansions
and Catastrophes, Pitman, London, 1976: "symbolic" stratum = E6 )




And from p. 105 of same source, "Siersma's Trick" for Double Cusp.




The K:Q = 2:1, 3:1, and 3:2 "power orbits" of the Spin Control Equation, displayed "six-pack" style, in
unit-per-half-edge, zero-centered boxes, as described in the text on the following pages.




                                                   Page 58
          In a pair of preprints, Zeeman's associates Ian Stewart and Tim Poston built a "quartic bracelet"

which tweaked out higher-order stratificational organization, devolving upon the hypocycloid of 4 cusps, or

"astroid," and exploiting the cross-ratio module as basis for foliation[26]. Meanwhile, the Double Cusp's

naming assumed that four minima defined the full unfolding, but James Callahan[27] demonstrated the

existence of a yet higher-order stratification, allowing for 5 minima (but not necessarily a 5-cusp bracelet).

This is as far as one can go, since 5 minima require separation by 4 maxima or saddles, and no unfolding of

"X9" can have more than 9 critical points (which is where the form's index number derives).

         This sequence emerges unbidden from the Spin Control Equation. If the two circles' exponents

are in fixed rational ratio, the three simplest such proportions among relatively prime integers are 2:1, 3:1,

and 3:2. (Since 1:0 or 0:1 gives us one or the other spin-unit circle, and 1:1 yields the imaginary orbits, we

discount these as "trivial." We also don't care about relative signing or positioning of the exponents K and

Q, as it makes no difference to our main point, and so assume both are similarly signed, and the leftmost is

the larger, in what follows.) Each generates closed helical windings about the torus for its orbit; and, if we

take the 4-D equivalent of an architect's plan, we get 6 planar sections, one per each pair of axes.

         As a quick bit of boilerplate building with a software package like Mathcad readily shows, these 6

sections can always be arrayed in 3 pairs, such that each pair contains all 4 axes. The pair containing the

(1, in ) and ( i0 , en ) planes will show isomorphic, identically sized, rose curves, containing K + Q "petals,"

each housing one stable regime or "minimum" - precisely what the hypocycloids in the "control" space

map into in "behavior" space. (In classical parlance dating back to Maclaurin and the first days of the

calculus, the latter is generated from the former as its "pedal curve" with respect to its center.)

         The pair containing the (1, i0 ) and ( in , en ) planes will show isomorphic, identically sized, epitro-

choids. These are curves of the broad family which Albrecht Durer first explored in the 1520's, generated

by a point attached to the (possibly extended) diameter of a small circle rolling around the circumference of

a larger, and corresponding, in the 2:1 case, to the map in "behavior" space of the HU's epicycloid (with

the rose-to-epitrochoid pairing obtaining for the higher strata.) The remaining planes, the intersections of

whose main diagonals with circles of radius (<U+00BD>)<U+00BD> correspond to the idempotents and their negatives --

<U+00BD>(<U+00B1>1 <U+00B1> en ) -- and their square roots <U+00BD>(<U+00B1> i0 <U+00B1> in ) respectively, contain Lissajous figures associated with the

ratios between the spin-unit circles' angular velocities.




                                                      Page 59
          We know that the 2-torus in 4-D is diffeomorphic to the 3-D doughnut, so that helical "currents"

are preserved in the 4- to 3-D projection. And, as we've just seen, the 6 planar sections boil down to 2 + 1

= 3 (the Lissajous figures' oscillation playing a role here akin to the dilating "third circle" used to map the

4-D orbits of the Quaternions into 3-space): i.e., to a 3-D pattern diffeomorphic to the 2-torus in 4-D.

         From what was said earlier about Peixoto's Theorem, stability of toroidal currents requires there

be two helices, with equal and rational winding numbers and opposite orientations. Assuming claims are

true, we can imagine an overarching regulation of movement through these three strata having an overall

symmetry of 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 = 120: the full symmetry group of the icosa- or dodeca- hedron. (Effect closure

by assuming that each pair in the K:Q ratio sequence cannot be "trivial," must have its sum one greater than

its predecessor, and that the larger integer in each equals or exceeds by 1 the larger integer in the prior pair.

Then we get 2:1, 3:1, 3:2, 4:2 ? 2:1; that is, relative primality makes the sequence loop.)

         One of the greatest surprises in singularity theory after the "A-D-E Problem" was formulated was

the incredible degree to which correspondences between fields could be traced: in particular, the icosahed-

ral reflection group just alluded to was found to govern unfoldings in the 4-D boundary of a 16-D manifold

(one per each plane of symmetry, plus the identity), as well as being connected with the generic problem of

"bypassing an o bstacle." This latter, in turn, was shown to be anticipated - albeit not in modern language!

- in the "outdated" study of the evolvents of curves pioneered by Huyghens in wave-front theory, specifi-

cally in diagrams Benniquen discovered of the evolvents of the semi-cubical parabola (itself the germ of

                                          3
the simplest, or Fold, Catastrophe Y = X ) in the very first textbook on analysis, written by L'H<U+00F4>pital from

Bernoulli's lectures[28]. (As Arnol'd understates the case, "the appearance of the regular polyhedra is

often unexpected.")

         The former result, though, due to Lyashko[29], suggests a frontier in "zero-divisor" study that

remains unexplored: what connections, if any, can be elicited between the three 16-D structures we've

seen are of interest? The superstring theorist's E8 x E8 is clearly not the same as the 16-D realization of the

icosahedral reflection group's symmetry whose (symplectic) boundary is Lyashko's focus: it is just the

direct product of two icosahedral rotation groups. But we know that H4 (the only higher-level analogue of

H3 ) has a group structure which is the direct product of two icosahedral reflection groups, and plays a key




                                                     Page 60
 role in the overarching theory of such five-fold singularities: Shcherbak's classic investigation of these in

fact shows five-fold-symmetric forms associated with H4 , H3 , and D6 [30] - the last item being shown by

Arnol'd to underwrite quasicrystals and their non-algorithmizable construction via the 3-D analog of Pen-

rose tiles[31]. But this, per Andr<U+00E9> Katz, lends itself to a tessellation with 22 differently decorated rhombic

tiles (of either "thick" or "thin" type)[32] - corresponding to the 22 "power orbits" in Mus<U+00E8>s' M-algebra for

the seven octonions, their corresponding spin-units (2 orbits each), plus one for "commutative i." (The

third 16-D structure, of course, to interrelate with these, is that of Sedenion space itself.)

         The Katz/M-Algebra construct is quite suggestive, in that "zero-divisors" are all over the place: in

the space determined by im <U+00B7> en = e[m xor n], m, n distinct, it's easy to see that points on the unit circle in the

(m,n) plane behave peculiarly: those (as well as all others) on the diagonals through the origin are square

                                                                     nth
roots of zero, and these points can, in turn, be shown to have 2           roots in higher dimensions (as Mus<U+00E8>s did,

with unfortunately awkward notation). These diagonal pairs, meanwhile (7*6 = 42 in number, like Sede-

nion Assessors) are asymptotes of hyperbolae, point-pairs on opposite branches of which demarcate the

axes of elliptical power-orbits - a simple enough result, the search for something kindred leading to finding

Yaglom's treatise on "parabolic geometry"(Reference 22.) This simple geometric support for an infinite-

dimensional extension of Galilean relativity is (typically buried) underneath the abstract language of

"nilpotent sheaves" and the like in superstring theory.

         The 16-D Lyashko singularity with boundary, especially given its close relationship to the "obsta-

cle bypass" evolvent context, is quite suggestive in its own right: in particular, a novel opening to explor-

ing some recent approaches to quantum non-localization would seem indicated. Readers are encouraged to

pursue the URL and/or text version of the source containing the quotes, while keeping the "Lissajous ping-

pong" motif broached much earlier clearly in mind. First, by implication, the "obstacle bypass" problem:

         One way of explaining quantum non-locality is through a hand-shaking space-time
         interaction between an emitter and its potential absorbers. The transactional interpretation
         does just this by postulating an advanced wave travelling back in time from the [future]
         absorber to the emitter. This interferes with the retarded wave, travelling in the usual
         direction from emitter to absorber to form the exchanged particle. Because both waves
         are zero-energy crossed phase waves, they interfere destructively outside the particle path
         but constructively between the emitter and absorber. The emitter sends out an offer wave
         and the absorber responds with a confirmation wave. Together they form a photon, just as
         an anti-electron (positron) travelling backwards in time is the same as an electron
         travelling forwards.[33]




                                                       Page 61
          Second, the problem of reflective boundary conditions is explicitly pinpointed as central to the

same problematic. This is spelled out in the paragraph immediately following that just cited:

         Although the transactional interpretation is completely consistent with quantum mecha-
         nics, it leads to some very counter-intuitive ideas. When I see a distant quasar, in a sense
         the quasar radiated the photon I see long ago, only because my eye is also here to per-
         ceive it. In a sense the quasar anticipated my presence and, despite its vastly greater ener-
         gy, it may not be able to radiate without the presence of myself and the other potential
         absorbers in its very distant future. This would imply that non-locality is observer depen-
         dent in a way which prevents any single observer having access to all the boundary con-
         ditions and hence logical prediction of the outcomes. This would prevent the universe
         from being computationally or deterministically predicted, but it would not prevent quan-
         tum non-locality from displaying relationships in which future states had an influence
         through being boundary conditions.



         In summary, a third brief snippet from the same text addresses the non-algorithmicity of quasi-

crystallic ordering, and its role as mediator between the chaotic and the quantized, quite succinctly:


         The quantum suppression of chaos noted in "scarring" of the wave function and other
         experimental results carries quantum chaos to the edge of quasi-periodicity. This is where
         order-from-chaos computation becomes possible, as illustrated by Conway's game of life
         and consistent with Freeman's model of perception.


         III: "Cuspoid sequence" - The simplest (because possessing but one behavior) strata are just

boxcars of minima and maxima (or straddles) strung together in an A-series chain. What is surprising is

just how high the strata are which the Double Cusp can contain: all of them, up through the 6-control A 7 ,

                 8
which unfolds X , "are really and exactly in there, despite apparently requiring higher order terms than we

have considered." (Reference 18, p. 323.) Those with even numbers of controls are "compact" in Zee-

man's sense, which means that regimes can't fall off the cliff or into the sky to infinity (which, pragma-

tically, means the cuspoids with odd numbers of controls are often best thought of as incomplete "inter-

rupts" requiring link-ups to something outside the ambit of the given "figure of regulation").

         The two-control "Cusp" is the simplest and most famous: models of such paradoxical two-control

behaviors as the rat who attacks when backed into the corner, the girl playing hard to get who succumbs

only when the boy pursuing her gives up, etc., have been produced in vast numbers since Zeeman began

teaching others to play this game. The maximal Cuspoid stratum can be thought of, then, as a stack of three

such Cusps, whose coinciding inside one stratum may be thought of as an aspect of what a programmer




                                                    Page 62
 would call the "UI" and not necessarily the "backend database." Put another way, the phenomena of real

interest may well exist in a "three-tiered system," access to each of whose modular layers is governed

minimally by a Cusp.

         Each such tier-specific Cusp, meanwhile, can be thought of as having the capacity to arbitrarily

bond with virtually any "behavior" beyond that defining its own dynamic, or the "umbrella dynamic" over-

sighting a "handshake": which "Y" is chosen to bond with a given "X," thanks to the so-called "Splitting

Lemma," is of no consequence as far as dynamics are concerned. This feature is of course absolutely criti-

cal for conceiving of software implementations allowing search and retrieval, with returns of not only pre-

cisely optimized quarry allowed, but those resulting from "bricolage" or "satisficing" as well. The Double

Cusp, meanwhile, allows Chaos to intrude in certain controlled contexts, suggesting that search algorithms

could employ chaos-theoretic "smart controllers," as first studied by Ott, Grebogi and Yorke in 1990, in the

general case. As a pointer to interesting directions worth following, systems architect Kent Palmer has

stressed the future role one can expect from "zero-divisor" number theory in the construction of any com-

puterized modeling of complex social interactions.[34] But clearly, such issues require separate study.

         "Three tiers" is the standard way of thinking about modeling sophisticated object-oriented systems

these days - the three tiers corresponding to backend data, intermediary "business logic," and user inter-

face. Each of these tiers could have its component parts scattered across any number of servers anywhere

in a global network, with each tier having a life of its own, provided interfacing with the other two is built

in as a given condition of the model. We've no reason to expect less than this degree of flexibility here.

         An expeditious manner in which to take advantage of such potential might go like this: look for a

way to "stretch" a Double Cusp (via symmetry constraints) so that the umbilic-strata machinery can pro-

vide the "message-passing" between the tiers. The starting point for such a procedure is in a classic pair of

papers by Thom[35] from the early 70's, wherein the sequence of control-space figures discussed above

(i.e., deltoid, astroid, pentagram) are deployed on what we'll call the "(T,V) screen" spanned by the two

lowest-order controls (operating on X and Y respectively), under the constraint of bilateral symmetry.

         Thom didn't treat these three as sequentially appearing in the same process; instead, they figure as

"moments" in one 5-control equation, where one of the 3 higher controls must be "off" to effect a space-

time unfolding. A logic paralleling that given earlier for collapsing the umbilic sequence to fit the contours




                                                     Page 63
 of H3 can be adopted, though, in what must be a "toy model" for now. Because of the symmetry constraint,

higher-order terms than are usually accessible can be controlled; in fact, in the deltoid control-space, Thom
                                                                                                        3
twiddles the equations to give, in effect, an elliptic umbilic with "zoom lens": the germ of the EU (X -

    2
3XY ) becomes a control, which we'll call "B," working alongside the usual "signature" control for the

                                          2    2
EU, which we'll call "C," operating on (X + Y ). Call this scaling or focusing effect the "offering."

         In the astroid control-space, the germ of the Double Cusp itself is a control - but it is not the stan-

dard germ; rather, it includes a value of the parameter that is outside the "sweet spot" discussed earlier -
                                                                   4       2 2       4
one equal to the Pascal coefficient attaching to its monomial: X - 6X Y + Y . Call this highest-order

expression's control "A." To revert to the sweet spot, the "6" must be tweaked to fall between <U+00B1>2. Assume

the tweaking is effected by a resonance with a Double Cusp on an adjacent tier in our three-tiered setup: an
                                                               2                 2
"octave," say, whose behaviors X*, Y* are such that X* <U+02DC> X and Y* <U+02DC> Y , so that, when "A" is on, we

get the astroid in the control plane of the two lowest-order controls (those operating on X and Y) by

                                                                   2   2                      2     2
assuming the standard EU "C" control is "on," too. (That is, X + Y "resonates with" X* + Y* , with the

mixed term with coefficient "6" representing, in effect, the "transaction cost.") Call this the "handshake."

         In the pentagram control-space, the sequential turning off of progressively lower controls comes to

a halt: only the two higher controls are "on." But there is a "my sterious change of sign" found to be re-

quired by computer simulations: the "zooming," once solicitous, now acts as a "counterpotential." This

led to a correction in Thom's second paper - and suggests a heuristic interpretation: after the offering and

handshake, the parties to the exchange, their business now concluded, walk away. Call this the "sign-off."

         As this monograph nears its own signing off, a last question must be considered: in what manner

can the above be construed as more than analogy or "toy modeling"? How, specifically, can we envision a

box-kite "doing read/writes" between two Double Cusps? The secret resides in the nature of the resonance

described: the "handshake" stage.

         An early result of Double Cusp theory was the drawing of its "generic section" in behavior space:

                                                               2
two intersecting, orthogonal ellipses, obeying the equation X <U+00B1> XY + Y2 = 1. Its direct relation to the

"Holy Grail" sectioning of the astroid stratification (the astroid, as he reminds us, can be classically viewed

as the envelope of a family of orthogonal ellipses) is nicely shown in Chillingworth[36]. The astroid can


                                                    Page 64
 also be seen - as the "Holy Grail" graphic displays clearly - as the projection into 2-D of the critical edges

of a curvilinear tetrahedron separating two orthogonally oriented, mirror-imaged bowls: a tellingly literal

portrayal of just where the "E6 " is hiding inside the "X9 "!

         Suppose each "bowl" (and hence, each ellipse) be seen as attaching to one of the two parties to the

"handshake" resonance. How relate this to the box-kite formalism? The simplest route to answering this

could involve another result of Charles Mus<U+00E8>s, one for which nobody, to this author's knowledge, has yet

found a use. This concerns another sort of "hypernumber," which he signified by the letter "w." (He con-

jectured there were numerous others, which also seem to bear relation to Catastrophe Theory's visual voca-

bulary; the ultimate such form, he speculated, would relate to solitons: a "mad" thought which was the

original inspiration for earlier remarks made herein).

         Mus<U+00E8>s' "w"-numbers have power-orbits which trace out the orthogonal ellipses according to the

equation in X,Y just given, but with X mapped to the reals, and Y to the "w"'s. The ellipse with a <U+00B1>XY

                                       k
tracks the exponential powers of (<U+00B1>w) respectively. Such orbits obey a 6-cycle (like our trefoils and triple-

zigzags); and, they are, in general, non-distributive (a trademark feature of "zero-divisor" arithmetic). This

much given, a method for deploying them as "hook-ups" between Double Cusps and box-kites suggests

itself, using the lanyards we dubbed "tray racks." These lanyards, recall, were incomplete: they came in

pairs, so that two such racks were needed to cover the "four-cornered square" such tandem structures span.

Finally, note that there are three sets of tray racks, residing in orthogonal plane sections - one such section

for each required mediation between the levels of our "three-tiered" software-system inspiration.

         Closing question: what is the relation of the "table inequivalence" (and "immune-system respon-

siveness") of the Sedenions, and the "infinite-codimensional chaos at the edge of the sweet spot" of the

Double Cusp? Of these two, to state vector collapse? To be pursued, perhaps, at some later date . . .

                      "Well, it's a long story," he said, "but the question I would like to
                     know, is the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything.
                     All we know about it is that the Answer is Forty-two, which is a little
                                                  aggravating."

                        Astroids, Holy Grails, and w-Numbers




The evolute of an astroid is another, bigger astroid: the midpoints of the latter's sides are the former's
cusps. The envelope of the family of normals to an ellipse is an astroid; the astroid, dually, is the envelope
of a family of ellipses. In the latter case, symmetry gives us the orthogonal ellipse pair with equation X2 <U+00B1>
XY + Y2 : the Double Cusp's "generic section" (corresponding to a "top view" of the Holy Grail shown in
the middle above, whose bowls' cross sections are our ellipses, with their tetrahedral join projecting down
to yield the astroid). Meanwhile, Mus<U+00E8>s' "w-Numbers" (top right) show power-orbits of (<U+00B1>w)k traversing
the same ellipses. (The infinite evolutive sequence of astroids, and G2 's analogous sequence of derivation
algebras for higher-order Cayley-Dixon processes, suggest a deep connection of the sort he sensed. Note,
too, his "v" numbers, which just happen to attach where so-called complex "whiskers" enter the bowls of
the Grail. Mus<U+00E8>s changed his mind about what these "v" might be; their only interest here is the peculiar
intuition of their perpetrator: somehow he was "seeing" higher-dimensional patterns of Double Cusp strata,
and sensing their relationship to patterns that cut deeper. How did he do that? And: can we run with it?)

    "The space of quartics is interesting because it is one of the most accessible instances of the phenome-

    non of modality [due to Arnold]: there are infinitely many orbits, most of which fall into families hav-

    ing continuous parameters. Here the parameter is the classical J-invariant, which is closely related to

    the cross-ratio of the roots of the quartic. . . . We show that the orbits form a singular foliation, with the

    modal families being hung around a skeleton of orbits of degenerate forms, which Chillingworth has

    dubbed the Holy Grail. It is the analogue for quartics of the deltoid observed by Zeeman."

    they come in two "real" forms, a problem not existing for the "complex"ones). Such inclusion would

    require, not X9 , but the G2 -like R10 . . . or, as will be implicit in discussing Thom's 1971 model below,

    special systems of John O'Malley and Barry Sandwell require, respectively, complex, quarternionic,

    and octonionic modeling; but what he terms the "Meta-system" requires "the Sedenion and higher

    Hyper Complex Algebras that lose the division property."(P. 44) He would seem to needlessly limit

    his agenda, however, by lumping together all such higher algebras: "All the higher algebras beyond

    the Sedenion are basically the same because there are no more interesting properties to be lost as we

    apply the Cayley-Dickson procedure to generate the even higher algebras" - a view with which this

    apparatus of his hypernumbers (from a formalist's perspective, it could legitimately be argued that he

    in fact never accomplished that); but rather, the vision of their purpose and raison d'<U+00EA>tre. We offer his

    remarks as a closing thought worth mulling on: "Now we come to the highest and last of any hyper-

    number which yields 1 when multiplied by itself a given number of times. Let us designate it by the

                                                                  2                  6
    symbol w. If we ascribe to w the following properties: (<U+00B1>w) = -1<U+00B1>w, and (<U+00B1>w) = 1, it turns out that w

    is the hypernumber that expresses the phase alterations and interactions with matter of what might be

    called pure noetic energy, both conscious and unconscious. We may call it the number of noetic

    energy. Note that, unlike 1, i, or e, the negative form of w behaves differently from its positive form,
                                 2      2
    and hence the equation (+x) = (-x) is no longer true if x is w." (Pp. 285-6) For less metaphysics, and

    more mathematical specifics, one must skim through the conjectures and unsubstantiated claims of the

    fascinating, but seldom rigorous, "Working with the Hypernumber Idea," in Charles Mus<U+00E8>s and Arthur

    Young, editors, Consciousness and Reality: The Human Pivot Point, Avon Books, New York, 1974,

    pp. 448-469. The w-numbers are discussed in passing here and there in Mus<U+00E8>s' papers cited earlier,

    and are also developed a bit (but not much) in Mus<U+00E8>s' Destiny and Control of Human Systems: Stu-

    dies in the Interactive Connectedness of Time (Chronotopology), Kluwer Academic, Boston,1985. In

    general, Mus<U+00E8>s' work sprinkles some brilliantly suggestive nuggets in a morass of irrelevancies, bla-

    tant mistakes, inflated claims, and promises of future results that never show up. (One thinks of Benoit

    Mandelbrot's remarks in The Fractal Geometry of Nature concerning Louis Zipf's largely unread

    book, from which he extracted the deep information-theoretic result called "Zipf's Law.") Yet such



                                                    Page 72
 excesses notwithstanding, his w-numbers (and remarks in the final appendix to "Working" contrasting

Eisenstein triples with the w-number 6-cycles show his intuition truly points in this direction) would

seem to offer a glimpse at a profound method for codifying G2 arithmetically - which could have enor-

mous significance, given G2 's role as the unique derivation algebra for all extensions of the Cayley-

Dickson process.

## Key Content

### Box-Kite Group Structure

The 7 box-kites in the sedenions are organized by a group structure inherited
from the octonion multiplication rules. The "placeholder" substructures are
specific arrangements of assessor indices that reveal deep number-theoretic
connections.

### Connection to Simplicial Dynamics

The paper connects the combinatorial structure of box-kite vertices and edges
to simplicial dynamics, showing that the topology of the ZD interaction graph
has interpretable dynamical properties.

### Key Theorem

The 42 primitive assessors partition into exactly 7 isomorphic octahedral
structures (box-kites), each characterized by a unique "missing" octonion
index (the strut constant). This is a concrete realization of Moreno's
abstract G_2 homomorphism result.

Abstract Methods for studying zero-divisors (ZD's) in 2n -ions generated by Cayley-Dickson process beyond the
Sedenions are explored. Prior work showed a ZD system in the Sedenions, based on 7 octahedral lattices ("Box-
Kites"), whose 6 vertices collect and partition the "42 Assessors" (pairs of diagonals in planes spanned by pure
imaginaries, one a pure Octonion, hence of subscript < 8, the other a Sedenion of subscript > 8 and not the XOR
with 8 of the chosen Octonion). Potential connections to fundamental objects in physics (e.g., the curvature tensor
and pair creation) are suggested. Structures found in the 32-ions ("Pathions") are elicited next. Harmonics of Box-
Kites, called here "Kite-Chain Middens," are shown to extend indefinitely into higher forms of 2n -ions. All non-
Midden-collected ZD diagonals in the Pathions, meanwhile, are seen belonging to a set of 15 "emanation tables,"
dubbed "sand mandalas." Showcasing the workings of the DMZ's (dyads making zero) among the products of each
of their 14 Asses sors with each other, they house 168 fillable cells each (the number of elements in the simple group
PSL(2,7) governing Octonion multiplication). 7 of these emanation tables, whose "inner XOR" of their axis -pairs'
indices exceed 24, indicate modes of collapsing from higher to lower 2n -ion forms, as they can be "folded up" in a 1-
to-1 manner onto the 7 Sedenion Box-Kites. These same 7 also display surprising patterns of DMZ sparsity (with
but 72 of 168 available cells filled), with the animation-like sequencing obtaining between these 7 "still-shots"
indicating an entry-point for cellular-automata-like thinking into the foundations of number theory.

 {0} Review of Prior Results, Motivations for Future Work: Zero divisors (ZD's), like
the "monsters" of analysis before Mandelbrot tamed them into fractals, have been largely
avoided as pathological by number theorists. In the last handful of years, however, there
has been a shift (largely driven by the needs of physics) toward taking them more seri-
ously. Guillermo Moreno, in 1997, pushed Lie algebraic tactics to the limit of their use-
fulness and discerned that the ZD's in the 16-D extension, by Cayley-Dickson process, of
the Octonions, conform to a pattern homomorphic to the Octonion's automorphism group
(and the derivation group of all higher 2n -ions from their 2n-1 -ion precursors), G2 .1 His
approach, however, was that of an "armchair theorist," in that only a single instance of an
actual pair of mutually zero-dividing numbers in the Sedenions was given. K. and Mari
Imaeda, meanwhile, focused on manipulating arbitrary (hence complicated) Sedenion ex-
pressions, uncovering the ZD's within them, eliciting their general function theory, etc.2
          Simultaneous with the Imaedas' "top-down" tactics, R. de Marrais took a comple-
mentary "bottom-up" approach, isolating underlying structures from which all complicat-
ed ZD expressions and spaces in the Sedenions must be composed - structures which "fly
under the radar" of classical techniques, requiring an initial calculation-heavy "dirtying of
hands" to be elicited and studied.3 A set of 3 simple "production rules" - and one even
simpler generic procedure - were found to suffice for creation of all basic patterns. All
points on the pairs of diagonal line elements of 3<U+00BD> dozen planes (dubbed the "42 Asses-
sors") in Sedenion space mutually zero-divide all other such points on certain other such
diagonals. Using the familiar convention of "XOR indexing" (the index of the unit of
each of the 15 imaginary axes would equal the XOR of the indices of any 2 units whose
product was equal to it), any combination of a pure Octonion (index < 8), and a pure Se-
denion (index > 8) which was not the XOR of the Octonion with 8, yielded one of 7 x 6
= 42 possible axis-pairs to span Assessor planes.
          Representing each such plane by a unique vertex, on one of 7 isomorphic octahed-
ral lattices, resulted in a set of "box-kites" whose 8 triangular faces represented either 4
"sails" sharing vertices with each other but no edges, or 4 empty "vents" in the remaining
4 faces. Tracing an edge along a "sail" connected two mutually zero-dividing diagonals
in different Assessors (with points on different diagonals belonging to the same Assessor
never zero-dividing each other). The orthogonal diagonals "/" and "\" of an Assessor's
"X," spanned, say, by imaginary axes iA and iB , would be shorthanded (A+B) and (A-B)
respectively, with the Assessor pair as such simply indicated as (A, B).
          The multiplication indicated by a box-kite edge would connect two mutually zero-
dividing numbers of either same ("/ /" or "\ \") or different ("/ \" or "\ /") orientation,
respectively indicated by a "+" or "- " drawn on the joining path. By continuing to trace
along a sail's edges, a sequence of mutually zero-dividing pairs (henceforth, "DMZ's,"
for dyads making zero) would be indicated. By tracing all edges of a sail twice over, in
the manner of a spinor's "double covering," all 6 diagonals (each making zero with one
each from the other two Assessors) would be involved in a single 6-cyclic sequence of
DMZ's, in one of two varieties: the 4 sails of any box-kite would partition into 1 "triple
zigzag" ("/ \ / \ / \": i.e., "- " signs on all edges; also the case for the opposite-face "vent")
and 3 "trefoils" ("/ / / \ \ \": i.e., "+"-signs on all but 1 edge), leading to a total of 6 edges
of each sign per box-kite. Other such patterns connecting DMZ sequences, both within
and between box-kites, were elicited, and rules were determined for constructing higher-
dimensional spaces, all of whose points would zero-divide those of other such spaces.



                                               Page 2
          One more simple property of box-kites must be indicated in this overview: each
of the 7 is uniquely associated with the one Octonion which does not appear among its 6
vertices. The vertex pairs on opposite ends of any of the 3 orthogonal "struts" stabilizing
the framework (like the wooden sticks of a "real-world" box-kite) do not form DMZ's -
and these are the only non-DMZ pairings in a box-kite. Moreover, the products of all 3
of these opposite pairs, depending on the "edge-signs" we might imagine on their struts,
display either a pair of the units of index 8 which, per Cayley-Dickson process, generate
the Sedenions from the Octonions; or, a pair whose index is the "missing Octonion" -
henceforth dubbed the given box-kite's "strut constant." And, as is easily checked, the
"inner XOR" of the Octonion and Sedenion pairs defining the Assessors at each box-kite
vertex will always equal '8' plus this strut constant.
         In the table below, the strut constant for each box-kite is listed in the first cell of
each row, with each vertex's Assessor index-pair listed in the 6 columns that follow. The
Octonion indices of the vertices A, B, C are in bold-face: their Assessors form a box-
kite's sole triple-zigzag (orange in the diagram, with trefoils red, blue, green). They also
form an associative triplet, in "NATO" format (for natural ascending triplet order, mean-
ing written so that AB = +C, BC = +A, CA = +B). In fact, each sail's Octonions, read
aright, form NATO triplets, viz.: A, D, E; F, D, B; and F, C, E. (Conversely, the 4 trip-
lets contained in any set of 6 Octonions each imply a sail in the box-kite whose strut
constant is the 7th.) Note, too, that in each plane spanned by 2 of the 3 orthogonal strut
pairs (A, F; B, E; C,D), a circuit of its square frame yields a sequence of 4 DMZ's; but,
due to the alternation of signs on the edges, it takes two such non-intersecting trips, each
linking with a different diagonal in each Assessor, to tour all the square's 8 ZD's.

          Before offering more pictures and describing further properties, let's consider just
how peculiar (and hence, perhaps useful) the results just described truly are. Specifically,
let's see how radically they differ from the only zero-dividing entities familiar (indeed,
indispensable) in fundamental physics. Though their couching in operator or Clifford
algebra formalism may hide their ultimate nature as number types from casual view, the
"projection" operators of quantum mechanics are, in fact, hybrid units in a toroidal
number space. (Imaginary, Quaternion, Octonion, and higher 2n -ion units, by contrast,
run through their paces in 2-, 4-, 8-, and 2n - dimensional spherical spaces.)
         The simplest such number-form torus is just the Cartesian product of two imagi-
nary orbits: the study of the 4-D result of two 2-D spaces containing the unit circles of
the Argand diagram. The Italian geometer Corrado Segr<U+00E8> first studied these "bicomplex"
numbers in the 1890's4 ; G. Baley Price wrote the first full-length text studying them as
such, and in depth, only in the 1990's.5 (They also are implicit in Roger Penrose's well-
known "twistor" formalism6 , and were the starting point of Charles Mus<U+00E8>s' less well-
known "hypernumber" program.7 ) Segr<U+00E8> noted the 4 axes defining their context were
generated by 2 imaginary units, the real unit, and a fourth "mirror number" whose unit
was a square root of +1 but not itself equal to +1. This last is well-known in its own
right: a space-spanning system of 3 such, mutually noncommuting in the manner of the
Quaternions from which one can derive them, are commonly called the "Pauli spin-matri-
ces." And as Mus<U+00E8>s' work (and the detail-work of the 8-D Clifford algebra Cl3 8 ) under-
scores, a "normal" imaginary (or quaternion) unit doesn't commute with any such "mir-
ror units" - but Segr<U+00E8>'s second imaginary (represented by the 2 x 2 identity matrix, but
with the usual i replacing each real unit on the main diagonal) commutes with both sorts.
         If we call the mirror unit m, the two diagonals in the (1,m) plane each have a
point which is idempotent: [<U+00BD>(1+m)]2 = <U+00BC> (1 + 2m + 1) = <U+00BD> (1+m); moreover, the
bracketed quantities, raised to arbitrary powers, remain unchanged, allowing for expo-
nential and other functions to be defined along the diagonals which have these points as
their "units" in a manner isomorphic to the workings of the real number line. These
points also have two other properties of note: 1) they are the centers of mutually orthogo-
nal Argand-diagram-like "power orbit" circles, with diameters extending from +m to +1,
allowing them to provide a second "S1 x S1" representation of the generation of the torus
containing them; and, 2) the product of these mutually orthogonal idempotents, as is
readily checked, is zero - making them nilpotent as well. In this latter aspect, they are
easily recognized as the number-form basis for "projection" operators.
         Such toroidal numbers, far from being "artificial," are forced upon us by nature's
penchant for balanced bookkeeping: they're what you get when you contemplate the
phase curves defined by linear equations with purely imaginary eigenvalues (e.g., in the
theory of oscillations of conservative systems). But perhaps it's artificial to consider
such projections into the Quantum Void as necessarily built up from such zero-divisor
dyads. Perhaps this restriction has something to do with the scandal of the universe's
"90% missing mass"? Spherical number forms, beginning with the Sedenions, have ZD's
on diagonals, too - but they're never idempotents, have no real components, obey a ter-
nary not binary logic, and those composed from the same units will never (as opposed to
always) form DMZ's. The difference between these two approaches is as radical as that
between the renormalization tactics used in plus-or-minus-charged, photon-gauged,
electromagnetism, and the three-color "strong force" of quarks and gluons.



                                              Page 4
           Among other possibilities, this just indicated difference has a bearing on how one
interprets the well-known "zero-point fluctuations" (ZPF) of the vacuum - as manifest in
the experimentally well-attested "Casimir force," which allows actual extraction of ener-
gy (admittedly in minuscule quantities!) from the Void. And this, in turn, soon involves
one in foundation questions concerning the interrelations of the quantum and general
relativistic realms. Standard quantum field theory represents ZPF via standard creation
and annihilation operators acting on the vacuum; and, as part of the same gesture, gravity
is treated as an exchange of so-called "gravitons" in flat [sic] spacetime.
          Alternative approaches are numerous; we note but two, which point back indepen-
dently to a 1968 "blue sky" piece by Andrei Sakharov9 . First is the deep investigation
initiated by Haisch, Rueda and Putoff,10 of a non-Machian, zero-point basis for inertia,
developed using the classical, Poynting-vector-based tools of stochastic electrodynamics.
In their view, mass can be seen as a way of characterizing the resistance due to the ZPF
(and general Quantum Vacuum) "molasses" that kicks in upon acceleration. (The asym-
metric distortion induced in the ZPF by accelerating bodies was demonstrated, as they
note, by Davies and Unruh in the mid-'70s, building on Hawking's "black-hole evapora-
tion" model.) They hypothesize that rest mass would similarly be associated with the
fundamental "restlessness" of a particle (Schr<U+00F6>dinger's "zwitterbewegung"), attaining to
resonance at the Compton frequency, thereby finding the origin of de Broglie's "matter
waves" in Doppler shifts of the ZPF spectrum. They further suggest expanding their
approach to peel back, in a manner first suggested by Sakharov, the formalism of general
relativity itself. Which segu<U+00E9>s into the second alternative approach.
          In a book-length investigation of Nonassociative Algebras in Physics, Jaak L<U+00F5>h-
mus, Eugene Paal and Leo Sorgsepp note two patterns they assume are interconnected.11
On the one hand, they observe that modern physics has built itself upon the recognition of
a sequence of "infobarriers" associated with ever less regular notions of number: with
relativity, imaginaries are associated with the restrictive causality of the light-cone; the
Heisenberg uncertainty relations depend upon the Quaternions' noncommutativity; argu-
ments are made for such phenomena as "exact color symmetry" and its concomitant
quark confinement being side-effects of the Octonions' nonassociativity.
          On the other hand, they note that attempts to quantize gravity largely fail due to
the unique nature of the gravitational force: the analog of the "fine-structure constant" is
in fact a variable. Phenomena at the ultra-small scale of the Planck length require a sec-
ond kind of quantization - not of action, but of distance itself, leading to a notion of a
spacetime "crystalline" structure. But it is almost tautological that this latticework is
volatile: below the Planck length, it decays, and "multiplicands" are somehow "elastic."
          Putting these two threads together, it seems hardly outrageous to suggest that
Sakharov's "metrical elasticity" underwriting gravity is directly connected to the next
breakdown of properties - the loss of a field-theoretic notion of norm by which ZD's are
spawned. Since all points of a ZD diagonal make DMZ's with any points of any other
suitably box-kite-connected ZD, can we not say a study focused on the "pre-metric" lat-
ticework of ZD's, in the Sedenions and beyond, provides the only logical way to explore
such phenomena - and, perhaps identically, the phenomenology of the "Creation press-
ure" leading up to the Big Bang? The connection, after all, of the Sedenions to the Dirac
equation, and hence quantum mechanics, is well known; and a link from the Sedenions'
ZD substrate to general relativity can also be strongly suggested, thanks to box-kites.



                                             Page 5
           The following diagram of a box-kite doesn't have signed edges, and has peculiar
symbols on its vertices, and its "sails" lack coloring; it is otherwise, however, indistin-
guishable from that provided above. This was hardly the intent of its creator, though: for
it is an aid in visualizing a key proof concerning the symmetries of the curvature tensor
in John Milnor's classic lecture notes on Morse Theory.12 Using the notation of affine
connections, Milnor states in a lemma that a Riemannian manifold's curvature tensor sat-
isfies four relations: (1) it is skew-symmetric (R(X,Y)Z + R(Y,X)Z = 0); (2) cyclically
ordered such triples of vector fields sum to zero (R(X,Y)Z + R(Y,Z)X + R(Z,X)Y = 0);
(3) bracket relations are skew-symmetric (<R(X,Y)Z,W> + <R(X,Y)W,Z> = 0) in outer
symbols, but (4) unchanged when inner and outer symbols are exchanged (<R(X,Y)Z,W>
= <R(Z,W)X,Y>). The fourth property is the most difficult, its proof requiring use of the
other three - and leading to the diagram as an aid to its following. Says Milnor:

        Formula (2) asserts that the sum of the quantities at the vertices of shaded
        triangle W is zero. Similarly (making use of (1) and (3)) the sum of the
        vertices of each of the other shaded triangles is zero. Adding these
        identities for the top two shaded triangles, and subtracting the identities for
        the bottom ones, this means that twice the top vertex minus twice the
        bottom vertex is zero. This proves (4), and completes the proof.




         With Sedenion-based box-kites, of course, the shaded triangles comprise the sails,
and the products along each of their edges are zero; the terms at opposed ends of struts,
meanwhile, obey a different relation from those connected to each other in a sail - not
their sums, but their differences, must be attended to. Can a small number of "symmetry
breaks" and/or "categorical removes" serve to link these radically different uses of the
box-kite diagram? The question is a deep one, and will be treated in follow-up studies.
For now, consider that: (1) tensor notation replaced the now largely extinct approach of
Dyads and Nonions; (2) J. J. Sylvester's Nonions focused on a number notion he thought,
from the vantage of determinant theory, exactly analogous to Quaternions, but involving
cube roots of +1 rather than square roots of -1, entailing 3 x 3 arrays of monomials asso-
ciated with 3 x 3 matrix representatives whose non-zero entries were 1's and imaginary
cube roots of unity13 ; (3) the monomials are precisely those which "Siersma's Trick" in
Catastrophe Theory displays for the Double Cusp14 ; (4) ZPF "drag force" is a third order
effect; and (5) while un-normed Sedenions do not obey an "n-squares law" like the Ima-
ginaries' (2, 2, 2), they permit, among other relations of interest, a (9, 16, 16) variant.15


                                             Page 6
           Only the general context of that fifth and last consideration will be dealt with
herein. For, properly appreciated, it suggests a "metalevel" from which to view quantum
phenomena comparable to that provided for viewing general relativity and the relation of
mass to inertia in the above discussion. The problem of "n-squares laws" generalizes the
Pythagorean theorem and its application to higher-dimensional analogs of distance: the
(2, 2, 2) rule for Imaginaries merely says, firstly, that any Imaginary can be construed as
a point on a circle, hence at a distance of a "radius" from the origin, so that the radius'
square is the sum of the squares of the abscissa and ordinate values of the same point;
and, secondly, that the product of two such points can itself be understood the same way.
          More elaborate extensions of the same Pythagorean logic lead to the (4, 4, 4) rule
for Quaternions (the product of one sum of four squares times another is yet another sum
of four squares), and, more elaborate still, to the (8, 8, 8) rule for Octonions. Hurwitz's
classic proof, though, of the breakdown of the norm (and hence field structure) beyond 8
dimensions, means that Sedenions are most readily assimilated to a (16, 16, 32) rule:
since any Sedenion can be partitioned into two sets of 8 coordinates A and B, the product
of two can be written (A+B) <U+00B7> (A'+B') = AA' + AB' + BA' + BB' = 4 x 8 = 32 dimen-
sions required. And as Cayley's friend, the Rev. T. Kirkman, showed more than a centu-
ry and a half ago, products of three or more Sedenions actually require a backdrop of 64
dimensions!16 All of which suggests that the indefinite cascades of virtual particles,
handled by renormalization methods, may perhaps signify something else entirely, but
"seen through a glass darkly": viz., the 8D-chunked (or, "going toroidal" in E8 x E8
superstring style, 8D + 8D-chunked) side effect of a "Bizarro World" mutation of Hilbert
space thinking, where a proliferation of ever more multiply connected ZD-nets of 2n -ions,
n approaching infinity, provides (at least the "cover story" for) the "hidden agenda."
          We will return to the general architectural issues implied here at the end of this
monograph, when we consider the Artificial-Life- or neural-net- like simulation-work
suggested by such blue-sky "Creation Pressure" thematics. What is clear here, though, is
that even broaching such topics makes adherence to the tried and true (and badly aging)
Lie algebraic toolkit seem (if not exactly laughable) inadequate. The best way to make
this patently obvious is to thoroughly and concretely investigate the realities being only
vaguely indicated by the highly useful (but clearly limited) "G2 " results of Moreno. In
later work than that cited earlier, he determines that the automorphism group of the ZD's
of all 2n -ions derived from the Cayley-Dickson process, from the Sedenions on up, obey a
simple pattern: for n > 4, this group has the form G2 x (n-3) x S3 (this last being the stan-
dard order-6 permutation group on 3 elements).17
          This says the automorphism group of the Sedenions' ZD's has order 14 x 1 x 6 =
84: the number of diagonal line elements, all of whose points form DMZ's only with
other such line elements, contained in the 42 Assessors. Let's expand our horizons to the
32-D and 64-D cases and give them names (since they currently don't have any!). Fol-
lowing the convention adopted by Tony Smith, who has called the 28 -ions Voudons after
the 256 deities of the Ifa pantheon of Voodoo or Voudon, we'll call these Pathions (for
the "32 Paths" of Kabbalah) and Chingons (for the 64 Hexagrams of the I Ching or Book
of Changes). For completeness' sake, we name the 27 -ions too, dubbing them Routons,
after that legendary source of high-tech innovativeness, Route 128 of the "Massachusetts
Miracle" that paralleled Silicon Valley's on the "Left Coast" of this country. From Reals
to Voudons, then, we extend the standard shorthand thus: R, C, H, O, S, P, X, U, V.

 {1} Using "Table-Driven" Cayley-Dickson to Excavate the Kite-Chain Midden:
         What is meant by "table-driven": in the early days of the PC Revolution (the one
focused on computing, not "correctness"), dBase II allowed you to do easy database pro-
gramming, but largely confined you to handling data at the record level. When the next
wave of tools emerged, Paradox (the precursor of the networked, SQL-based juggernaut
that Oracle launched) let you use a simple logic of columnar links and commands to op-
erate on entire tables of data. In the transition phase between technologies, it was not
uncommon to take dBase programs that took an hour to run and replace them with Para-
dox routines that did the same job in under a minute. The moral of this story is: the way
the Cayley-Dickson process (henceforth, CDP) is typically presented (and, apparently,
used) is like dBase II. If we're to do anything interesting with ZD patterns in 2n -ions, n
large, we must follow the example of Paradox. (And, of course, we must also drop our
pencils at some not so far off point and write programs!) We will soon see that the
"table-driven" approach to the CDP is ridiculously easy to employ and explain.
         What the "Kite-Chain" (pronounced "kitchen") "Midden" is: the PC Revolution
was roughly contemporary with the spread of the "object-oriented programming," or
"OOP" paradigm. Its way of viewing things provides a handy (and deep-running) meta-
phor for thinking about zero divisors. Two key notions in OOP lore are design-hiding
and garbage-collecting (the latter conveniently built into the Java language). The first
embodies the precept that a maintainable and reusable design module will "privatize" key
variables, denying external users direct access to them. Beginning at least with "quark
confinement," Nature seems to make its innermost secrets likewise difficult of access.
However, Nature - from the panda's thumb to the microwave background radiation of the
cosmos - also does an imperfect job at covering up its tracks: pragmatic trade-offs being
what they are, allocation and deallocation of memory is never perfectly handled by any
"garbage collection" algorithm, in Nature or in software. Indeed, one way of looking at
archaeology (and in this sense, cosmologists studying the faint traces of the Big Bang's
aftershocks are engaged in it) is that this imperfection makes it possible.
         A midden, in Old English, comes from the word for "dung heap," and has come to
mean, to archaeologists, a specific thing: the heaps of broken dishes, worn-out cutlery,
sabre-tooth tiger bones, and other refuse tossed into deep recesses of inhabited caves or
other primitive dwelling sites over the millennia: such kitchen middens provide a trea-
sure trove of information on our ancestors' digestive tracts, sophistication of toolcraft,
and countless other matters that students of the past crave to (literally) unearth.
         Divisors of zero are likewise a "dung heap" of number-theory leavings which no
one's had much use for; yet it is possible to excavate their layers and find some surprising
patterns which extend indefinitely into remote reaches not of antiquity, but of "2n -ionity"
(which indeed might signify the ultimate antiquity of things leading up to and immediate-
ly out of the Big Bang anyway). The endless succession of layers in this "dig" takes the
form of a never-completed chain of box-kite-like entities, hence the "kite-chain" (said
"kitchen") qualifier on the "midden." With a table-driven CDP in hand, the intricacies of
the kite-chain midden will be easy to elicit. And once we've grasped their workings, the
patterns they reveal to us will make us doubt the generality of the "G2 " approach! (Espe-
cially when we see, in the section after this one, that as badly as Moreno's "upper bound"
is exceeded by the kite-chain midden, a slew of more elaborate ZD structures we'll call
"sand mandalas," first appearing in the Pathions, exceed such limits even more!)



                                             Page 8
           How the CDP works: like the route to Chaos we think the CDP resembles, there
is a "period-doubling" (here, doubling of dimension) which the CDP algorithm captures
by partitioning the numeric entities of its next level up in two parts: units whose indices
are contained in the starting-point 2n -ions go to the left of the comma, and those whose
indices range from 2n to 2n+1 -1, go to its right - but with 2n subtracted from them. The
complex numbers, to start (as the CDP does) with the simplest case, have n = 0, and are
inscribed (a,b), with a and b scalars multiplying the units i0 and i1 - reals and imaginaries.
          The product of two complex numbers, written (a,b) and (c,d), expands and recon-
tracts as follows: (ai0 + bi1 )(ci0 + di1 ) = (ac - bd)i0 + (ad + bc)i1 = (ac - bd, ad + bc).
CDP doubling yields the Quaternions, which obey much the same pattern. But since their
units don't commute, order matters. And since there's more than one imaginary unit to
deal with, indices must be made explicit, and so must the higher-dimensional analog of
complex conjugates. With simple imaginaries, the conjugate of C = (ai0 + bi) is just C* =
(ai0 - bi), so that C<U+00B7>C* = a2 + b2 ; for general Quaternion Q = (ai0 + bi1 + ci2 + di3 ), the
conjugate Q* is likewise (ai0 - bi1 - ci2 - di3 ), and Q<U+00B7>Q* = a2 + b2 + c2 + d2 . In CDP
notation, we get (a + bi1, c + di1 ) and (a - bi1, -c -di1 ) respectively. For general 2n -ions,
the M and M* always have equal components, of opposite sign for non-real terms only.
          Here, we see that the i2 term (and, more generally, the term whose index is the
next-higher power of 2) acts as the generator of the new units appearing at the next level
(hence, has the same index - 0 - on the right of the comma that the real unit has on the
left); as such, a generator always produces same-signed resultants when applied on the
same side of an arbitrary unit among the 2n -ions it generates. Given that one can't index
even the Octonions so that all NATO triplets are also in counting order - (1, 7, 6) and
(3, 6, 5) are out of order in the usual XOR indexing scheme, for instance - this implies
that no imaginary unit except the generator will always produce a same-signed resultant
with arbitrary other units multiplied from the same side. This special feature of genera-
tors has far from trivial ramifications with higher 2n -ions, as we'll see soon enough.
          We need note one more general feature before giving the standard iterative CDP
algorithm, for it's more general than we need. We can generate higher-order systems of
mirror, imaginary, or "dual" numbers (which square to 0), by setting a parameter to +1 or
- 1 or 0 respectively, and create mixes of such systems by varying the parameter at each
successive CDP iteration. (One can even set the last of 4 parameters to a radical, to em-
bed the Sedenions in an extension field which has no zero divisors at all. More generally
still, one can exploit the theory of so-called "Pfister forms" - or engage in category theo-
retics to similar effect - and define the CDP over polynomial fields, expunging zero-divi-
sors and tying 2n -ions to quantum groups in one fell swoop18 : such nifty tricks, however,
won't concern us.) For our purposes, all parameters will be -1's; for completeness, we
give the general expression, with the most recently iterated parameter written p:

                     X <U+00B7> Y = (A,B) <U+00B7> (C,D) = (AC + p(D*)B, B(C*) + DA)

        If the component parts are not complicated admixtures, but simple sets of non-0-
indexed imaginary units with unit coefficients, we can treat conjugation as just negation,
and write only indices and signs (M - N, instead a<U+00B7>iM + b*<U+00B7>iN). Which gives us this:

                         X <U+00B7> Y = (A,B) <U+00B7> (C,D) = (AC + DB, DA - BC )



                                               Page 9
         Before we go into "table-drive," let's make this real with a worked example.
Going back to the Box-Kite diagram and its associated table, let's take a random path
between vertices - BC, say, on the triple zigzag ABC. Now, let's pick a random strut
constant: 6, for instance. The table says B then equates to the Assessor (4,10), and C to
(7,9). The sign on the edge is minus, so let's flip a coin and pick the "+" diagonal to be
B, the "-" to be C: this means multiply (i4 + i10 ) by (i7 - i9 ). By the formula, we get:

                     (4, 2) <U+00B7> (7, -1) = ( [(4)(7) - (1)(2)], [- (1)(4) - (2)(7)] )

         Refer to the relevant "NATO triplets": (3, 4, 7); (1, 2, 3); (1, 4, 5); (2, 5, 7). The
CDP comma separates O's from S's, the latter generated from the former by the unit in-
dexed 23 = 8, so we get (3 - 3, -5 - (-5)) = (+i3 - i13 ) + (- i3 + i13 ). For "hard" parenthe-
ses, "pair creation from the Quantum Void" is suggested; for "soft," we just have 0.
         Note that 3 xor 13 = 6, the strut constant, as required. Furthermore, (3, 13) has
edge sign "-", so we can continue edge-multiplying and get further zeros in a DMZ 6-
cycle, and say that the Assessor (3, 13) at vertex A is "emanated" by Assessors (4, 10)
and (7, 9), with (4 + 10)<U+00B7>(3 - 13) = (3 - 13)<U+00B7>(7 + 9) = [pair creation or] 0, and so on.
         It's easy to find multiplication tables for the Octonions, and also easy to build one
for the Sedenions; no higher tables have been published that we know of, but we don't
need them. All we need do is realize that the table for 2n+1 -ions is comprised of 4 tables
of the same size as that for the 2n -ions, with the latter table constituting the upper left
quadrant of the larger ensemble, its row and column values running from 0 to 2n - 1.
Calling this quadrant "I," and continuing to designate the other 3 by successive Roman
numerals in clockwise order, we can fill in all values of each of these by a simple trans-
formation of the ensemble of 2n -ion values in I.
         Quadrant II: Row values same as I ; column values of nth column of II = those
for n column of I + 2n . Hence if product of row-unit r and column-unit c in I is written
     th

(r, 0)(c, 0) = (rc + 0, 0<U+00B7>r - 0<U+00B7>c) = rc = entry in cell (r, c), then cell (r, 2n + c) in II will be
(r, 0)(0, c) = (r<U+00B7>0 + c<U+00B7>0, c<U+00B7>r - 0) = (0, -rc) = -(2n + rc), with "special handling" for r or c
= 0 or r = c. In the last case, since any in 2 is negative unity, the cell entry will be the odd-
looking "-0" (short for -i0 = -1) in the long diagonal of I. The peculiar status of the gen-
erator - any smaller-indexed positive unit u multiplying it on the left yields the positively
signed unit whose index is 2n + u - means that the corresponding long diagonal in II will
show (- 2n ) for all entries save the first row's. Corollarily, all entries in the first row and
column will be positive, with content 2n greater than the corresponding cell in I.
         To simplify, collectively refer to the extension of the top row, the first new (2nth )
column, and the main diagonal of II the "trident"of II (with tridents in all quadrants de-
fined analogously). Then we can sum up this way: the index-values in cells (r, 2n +c) =
2n + (r, c); sign of cells (r, 2n +c) = same as for (r, c) if in trident, opposite otherwise.
         Quadrant III: by similar arguments, cell entries in trident of III are identical in
content to corresponding entries in trident of I, and same in sign except for the leftmost
(2nth ) column, where signs are reversed; for all other cells, (2n + r, 2n + c) = same in
content and opposite in sign as (r, c).
         Quadrant IV: for each entry (2n + r, c) content is identical to that in correspond-
ing cell (r, 2n + c) of II, with signs reversed in the trident (except for the extension of 0th
column), but the same everywhere else.



                                               Page 10
          Naturally, the best way to grasp the iterative workings of this process is to exam-
ine a concrete for-instance where it's been applied multiple times. On the next page, we
give the multiplication table for the Sedenions (the Pathions' 32 x 32 array won't fit), us-
ing a checkerboard scheme of shading alternate Quaternion-sized blocks of cell entries, to
make the iterative structure easier to parse visually. Beneath this table, we give a listing
of the (25 -1)(25 -2)/3! = 155 NATO triplets in the Pathions (which we'll be focused on
most), with the triplets first appearing in the Octonions and Sedenions broken out separ-
ately at the top of the listing. Beyond the Pathions, even a listing of triplets becomes un-
manageable, as there are (26 -1)(26 -2)/3! = 651 of them for the Chingons alone, so readers
interested in checking calculations involving them later in this argument will need to feed
Pathion triplets into the CDP formula (or write code!).
         One crucial matter the "table-driven" approach makes obvious: since no box-kite
vertices have "trident" entries, one gets box-kite "harmonics" simply by adding 16 (or 32,
or 48 ... ) to their indices. These entities are not "stand-alone," however: for o, o', o"
Octonions; S, S', S" Sedenions; n an integer; two "Assessor harmonics" with indices (o +
16n, S + 16n) and (o' + 16n, S' + 16n) will emanate some (o" [ = o xor o' = S xor S' ], S"
[ = o xor S' = S xor o' ] ) contained in the basic box-kite. Each of the 12 paths in such a
harmonic, then, will have its "sail" completed by the Assessor in the "base-line" box-kite
whose harmonic, by visual logic, "ought to" complete its sail, but doesn't.
         Stranger still, if we consider all 3 harmonics allowed when we double domains up
to the 64-D Chingons, not only will the base-line box-kite complete sails in each, but the
first harmonic will form an "overtone series" with the second and third: "sails," that is,
will have one "Assessor harmonic" from each! For example, if the base-line is the box-
kite with strut constant 3, its Assessor strut-pairs are (2, 9) and (1, 10), (5, 14) and (6, 13),
and (7, 12) and (4, 15) - the first-listed in these pairings forming the box-kite's triple-zig-
zag. The "Assessor harmonics" for n = 1, 2, 3 respectively are therefore, in same order:

     (18, 25) and (17, 26)            (21, 30) and (22, 29)             (23, 28) and (20, 31)
     (34, 41) and (33, 42)            (37, 46) and (38, 45)             (39, 44) and (36, 47)
     (50, 57) and (49, 58)            (53, 62) and (54, 61)             (55, 60) and (52, 63)

        "Sails" involving all 3 of these harmonics can be constructed in sets of four, each
set completed by one of the 6 Assessors in the first harmonic. For the lowest-index
instance, the four sails are these:

             (17, 26) - (36, 47) - (53, 62)             (17, 26) - (37, 47) - (52, 63)
             (17, 26) - (38, 45) - (55, 60)             (17, 26) - (39, 44) - (54, 61)

         If we only consider the first harmonic - all we get with just the Pathions - we
have a system of twice the number of ZD-diagonals in a base-line box-kite, all inter-
related in the manner just described. This fits quite nicely with Moreno's assessment of
the total count of "irreducible" zero-divisors we should have: per his formula, 25 -ions
should have (5-3) x 84 = 168 such entities. But clearly, the formula breaks down with
one more doubling: when the kite-chain midden is extended to 26 -ions, we get not 3 x
84, but 4 x 84 = 336 ZD-diagonals: the maximal symmetry of Felix Klein's famous
figure that Poincar<U+00E9> determined was a tessellation by triangles of the hyperbolic plane.19

 {2} The Pathions' "Sand Mandalas" (Surprises in Symmetry and Degeneracy): In
the listing of triplets just given, those none of whose 3 pairings can act as Assessors (i.e.,
contribute ZD's) are rendered in italics. These include all the Octonions, all Sedenions
with an '8,' and all Pathions with a '16.' And, just as each of the 7 x 3 "8-less" Sedenion
triplets of form (O, S, S') produced two Assessor index-pairs - (O, S) and (O, S') - mak-
ing 42 in all, so the Pathions have 15 x 7 = 105 "16-less" triplets of form (O or S, P, P'),
and which yield 210 "Assessors" organized in 15 ensembles which are the Pathion equi-
valent of Box-Kites. In addition, as implied in the above discussion of kite-chain mid-
dens, 42 of the (P, P') pairings are ZD's as well, which makes 252 x 2 diagonals in each
= 504 "irreducible" ZD's specific to the Pathions. Add in the 84 first showing in the Se-
denions, and we have 588 in all: 3<U+00BD> times the count Moreno's formula would allow.
          The 15 Pathion ensembles of Assessors have many features we've already seen in
box-kites: Assessors at all 14 vertices of the analogous lattice have the same inner xor,
its value - one of 15 possible (O or) S indices - acting as the ensemble's signature. This
signature plays the role of "strut constant" as well, so that the Assessors at the 14 vertices
are arrayed in opposing pairs which do not form DMZ's, since their products include
non-canceling pairs of strut-constant-indexed and index-16 imaginaries. And, as with
box-kites, not just the (here, index- 16 instead of 8) generator, but the Assessor whose
Pathion is the xor of the strut constant with it, is also excluded from the lattice.
          While this much is easy to see, visualizing the connectedness of these ensembles
is hard: with each having 14 vertices, possibly forming DMZ's with all but 1 of the
others, we have 84 edges, forming (14 x 12)/3! = 28 "sails," divvied out among 7 Box-
Kites, each of which shares each of its 3 strut with 2 of the others. We say "possibly
forming" advisedly: one of the most surprising features of these ensembles - and why, as
we'll see, we call them "sand mandalas" - is that the full count of 168 DMZ's is only ob-
tained when the strut constant is 8 or less. And, when it is precisely 8, we get a peculiar
phenomenon we'll call "edge polarization." To grasp these things, however, a different
sort of visualizing strategy is called for. In a partial generalization of the table appended
to the box-kite diagram toward the start of this paper, we'll display the behaviors of the
sand mandalas in 14 x 14 spreadsheet-like layouts we'll call emanation tables.
          As with the column headings there, indices will be arranged to best satisfy two
sometimes conflicting constraints. First, Assessors on opposite ends of a strut are given
symmetrically opposite placement, so that indices have "nested parentheses" ordering
(just as columns A and F, B and E, and C and D formed strut-opposed pairings in the
earlier table). Second, when this first constraint allows (as it does for the first half of the
column heads for all sand mandalas with strut constants of 8 or greater), the lower-
indexed Assessors from all strut-pairs should have their O or S terms placed atop the
columns in ascending left-to-right order (and top-to-bottom order on the rows).
          When arranged in this manner, all cells of both long diagonals of the table will
always be empty: those running from the upper left toward the bottom right represent
products of an Assessor's diagonals with themselves, and these can never form DMZ's;
those running downward from the upper right, meanwhile, represent products of "strut
opposites," and these will always contain pairs of index-16 and strut-constant-indexed
imaginaries. The remaining 142 - (2 x 14) = 168 cell entries are assumed, by convention,
to be the O or S indices of the ZD "emanated" by multiplying the row-head's Assessor
times the column-head's, with appropriate edge-sign prefixing the entry.

         We'll construct the first "emanation table," for strut constant = 1, now. All the
Assessors have inner xor 17, units indexed 1 and 16 are excluded, and "nested parenthe-
ses" plus left-right (top-bottom) ordering give us the Sedenions listed in the first line as
column and row headings, associated with the Pathions of index > 16 listed below them:

         Note that all 168 available cell-entries are filled with emanations: save for the
diagonals, all row-listed ZD's form DMZ's with all column-listed ZD's. As a harbinger
of things to come, however, the eighth such table (strut constant indexing the Sedenions'
generator) shows a peculiar alignment: in each quadrant, all edge-signs are identical. In
upper left and lower right, they're negative, and positive otherwise. As is readily shown
by writing products in CDP form and recalling that all inner xor's will equal 16 + 8, this
is a side-effect of the peculiar characteristic of generators mentioned earlier: namely, all
their products with lower-indexed units, if taken on the same side, have the same sign.
         More subtle, and far more surprising, is an effect ultimately attributable to the
same root cause, but by a less transparent route: when the strut constant gets bigger than
the generator's index, only 72 of the available cell-entries contain emanations. Even
more mysterious, if we subtract 8 from the strut constant and call this the "excess," then
48 of these cell entries saturate the rows and columns at a distance of the excess from the
outer boundary: hence, for strut constant 9, all the outermost cells save for the 4 corners
are filled, and for 15, a cross of central rows and columns (minus the central square the
diagonals make) is formed, with contents evenly divided among allowed row- and col-
umn- heading Sedenions, save for '8' and the excess. Instead, these excepted entries are
equally dispersed among the remaining 24 filled cells, with the edge-signs always nega-
tive for entries of index '8' (and always positive for index equal to the excess), and re-
stricted to the same quadrants as the '/' and '\' empty diagonals respectively.



                                                         Page 14
          Viewed in sequence, these tables suggest the patterns made by cellular automata;
seen individually, they suggest nothing so much as the short-shelf-life "sand mandalas"
of Tibetan Buddhist ritual, made by monks on large flat surfaces with colored sands or
powdered flowers, minerals, or even gemstones. To best convey this sensibility, all 7 of
the 72-entry tables (prefaced by the "edge-polarized" table generated by strut constant 8)
are arrayed in two rows of four each, to be scanned left to right, top row first. They have
also been color-coded: the void diagonals are left empty; the cells which "should" be
filled but are magically left content-free are painted gray; the 24 entries made of strut-
constant components are green; the 48 which contain all other allowed entries are ren-
dered in red. (Rendered originally in MS Word tables, the cell-entry contents are quite
readable at 200% zoom in their native application; they become muddy, however, and
hard to read, when zoomed in the PDF format they were ported to, for which we offer our
apologies. In one sense, though, this "bug" is a "feature": it demands you attend to the
overall patterning, which is obviously what matters most here!)




          We're not yet done with surprises: for just as Kite-Chain Middens indicate a way
in which low-level structure can be echoed higher up the endless 2n -ion ladder, the seven
72-cell sand mandalas show us the way to collapse from one level of form to that native
to a level lower down. If we fold any of their tables along their row and column mid-
lines, the red cells of the sand mandala in question will overlay precisely and only those
O's and S's which form the vertices of the Box-Kite whose strut constant is equal to the
"excess." The cells painted green, on the other hand, will adjoin the Sedenions' index-8
generators and the Box Kite's own strut constant in a trio of ensembles, one per strut - or,
said another way, one for each "forbidden" O-triplet containing the strut constant.
          We can imagine the Pathion units associated uniquely with each emanation-table
entry being "boiled off" by some reductive process, the possible nature of which must be
left for future contemplation. We can also, of course, imagine "Sand-Mandala-Chain
Middens," echoing their basic structure in a modulo-32 rhythm. And we can imagine
even richer possibilities with the 31 emanation tables associated with the Chingons . . .
"restless triplet" cyclings connecting all such systems . . . and so on.


                                            Page 15
         To reach an understanding of the happenings in higher reaches, a more formal
grasp of the simplicities underlying the surprises in the Pathions would stand us well. We
know that units indexed g = 2n - hence, any generators of the next (2n -1) units via CDP -
operate in a uniquely uniform way. For all units iu , u < g, iu <U+00B7> ig = + i(u+g) . In the upper
left ("NW") quadrant of the emanation table, meanwhile, all row and column index-pairs
can be written (r, R) and (c, C) respectively, where lower-case indices all are O's, and
upper-case are P's (all > 16). Specifically, for all 72-celled sand mandalas, each Asses-
sor's inner xor ("ix") = 24 + <U+039E> , where <U+039E> ("xi") is the "excess" in the range of 1 to 7.
        But 24 is the sum of the first two generators which yield ZD behavior. Multiplied
with O's, the combined effect of the unilateral signing behavior of each taken separately
is reversed: i24 <U+00B7> iu = + i(24+u) . Further, if iu <U+00B7> iv = + iw makes an O triplet, i(24 + u) <U+00B7> i(24 + v) =
+ iw also. (By CDP, we get (- i(8 + u) <U+00B7> i(8 + v) ); this gives + iw by the "Quadrant III" rule
applied to generation of S's from O's.) Hence, for all u = r or c in the NW box, the term-
by-term signing of the two pairs of units in the product (r, 24 + r*) <U+00B7> (c, 24 + c*) will be
the same as for (r, r*) <U+00B7> (c, c*). But this latter just involves O's, and so lacks the sign-
canceling among like-indexed terms DMZ's require - and so, therefore, must the former!
        The only way around this null result is for one of the indices of R, C, or R xor C
to be precisely 24, with corresponding index r, c, or r xor c precisely the excess <U+039E> . Say r
= <U+039E> , left-multiply (c, C) by (r, R), and leave a sign-variable sg(..) = <U+00B1> (..) undetermined:

         (<U+039E> , 24) <U+00B7> (c, 24 + c*), where c <U+00B7> c* = sg( <U+039E> ), and hence <U+039E> <U+00B7> c = sg( c* )

         Left-multiplying by <U+039E> , then 24, we get these indices in successive output lines:

         <U+039E> <U+00B7> c <U+00E0> sg( c* ),          <U+039E> <U+00B7> (24 + c*) <U+00E0> 24 + (<U+039E> <U+00B7> c*) = ( - sg(24 + c) )
         24 <U+00B7> c <U+00E0> (24 + c),         24 <U+00B7> (24 + c*) <U+00E0> (- c* )

          Comparing cross-terms in the two lines, it's clear we have a zero product, with the
edge between (r, R) and (c, C) being signed the same as sg. Supposing c is <U+039E> instead
leads to the same result with a change of labels; slightly more work is called for if <U+039E> is in
the product instead of either multiplier. By symmetry, the same ZD criteria just demon-
strated can be appropriately interpreted in all quadrants. The 72-count (not just of non-
void cell entries, but of distinct DMZ pairings of ZD diagonals) follows trivially.
          That last parenthetical remark is a signal one: in Sedenion Box-Kites, the 12 ZD
diagonals in each, each belong to 2 Sails, making 24 DMZ's in all. In this, they conform
to the same formula we can generalize from the sand mandalas with <U+039E> > 0: for 2n -ions,
n>3, the ZD-pairings formula, up to Voudons, gives 6 <U+00B7> (2n-1 -4) = 24, 72, 168, 360, 744.
Alone in this series, the pairings for Pathions are a simple multiple of their predecessors'.
A little investigation shows us why: each of the 7 "excessive" sand mandalas can in fact
be partitioned into 3 Box-Kites, all sharing the same strut constant, but otherwise exactly
like those in the Sedenions - save for their each containing an "impossible" 8 as the low
index in one Assessor, forming a triple zigzag with two Assessors whose low-index terms
are an O and its xor with 8! So not only can we "fold over" its emanation table to get a
Sedenion Box-Kite; we can see it as housing 3 "harmonics" of it of a special kind. The
analogy to the Hyperbolic vs. Elliptic Umbilic Catastrophes' 1 to 3 Cusps, vis <U+00E0> vis 1
triple-zigzag to 3 trefoil Sails, was explored in our prior paper. How deep does it go?


                                                 Page 16
           In Catastrophe Theory, the D4 singularity takes on two forms when projected
from the complex to the real domains, and these are the two Umbilics just named. More,
it is also well-known, thanks to the "A-D-E Problem,"20 that the D4 pattern relates to
close-packing in 4-D, yielding the "Feynman checkerboard" of 24 unit hyperspheres in
each other's immediate proximity (the same pattern giving the 24-element group of
integer Quaternions). The Hyperbolic Umbilic, meanwhile, has its 2-D "behavior plane"
- when its definitive control variable is zero - degenerate into the 4-to-1 collapsing of
quadrants topologists call "folding the handkerchief." The similarity of this process to
the "folding over" of emanation tables - plus the special significance of 24 here - seems
hardly accidental. (And 72, for what it's worth, is the "closest-packing number" associ-
ated with the singularity E6 - the basis of the mysterious "trance tunnel" geometry stu-
died by James Callahan in a series of seminal papers modeling emotional affect re-
sponse.21 ) How might these patterns echo in higher number forms? We have not, for
instance, considered the "pathologies" awaiting in higher 2n -ions, when not 2, but 3 or
more such "hypernumbers" are multiplied. (Will we need, perhaps, to contemplate "ema-
nation solids"? And does the fact that both the Sedenions' 24 and the Pathions' 72 are
contained as simple factors of the Routons' "Babylonian" 360 mean anything special? In
this domain, so little is known, and so much computation will be required to learn more,
that we can truly deem this brand of mathematics an "experimental" discipline.)
          Let's wind down with something more concrete to mull on: the emanation table
shown as the last on the right of the top row in the prior illustration (with <U+039E> = 3) will be
exemplified. Its "green cell" units of 3 and 8 indicate a "folding over" into the Sedenion
Box-Kite with strut constant 3; the low-end indices shown in the emanation table do in-
deed "fold over" in the manner described above so that strut-opposed terms form Sedeni-
on Assessors (2, 9), (1, 10), (7, 12), (6, 13), (5,14), (4,15) as required. Meanwhile, if you
check the first table presented in this paper to corroborate that statement, you'll recall the
format of presentation (Assessors A, B, C forming a triple-zigzag, etc.). That format can
be retrieved (sans the now-redundant strut constant in the left-most column) to present
the 3 "impossible" Box-Kites the emanation table in question partitions into (each of
whose triple-zigzags' bolded lower-index terms form hard-working, Box-Kite-sustaining
"mule-trains" of "sterile" triplets which can never form ZD's in their own right). This
emanation table partitions into 3 Box-Kites with strut constant 11 as follows:

                           A      B       C       D       E        F .

                        1, 26   8, 19    9, 18   2, 25   3, 24   10, 17

                        4, 31   8, 19   12, 23   7, 28   3, 24   15, 20

                        6, 29   8, 19   14, 21   5, 30   3, 24   13, 22

        Note that the common appearance of the (8, 19) and (3, 24) Assessors in each of
these 3 Box-Kites would seem to belie the assertion that they partition the 72 DMZ cells
cleanly: but this shared pair of Assessors are strut-opposites, and we are now viewing
these Box-Kites not as collections of 12 ZD diagonals, but of 24 DMZ-pairings; so, as
such, there's no sharing of any terms between them! From all we've seen of the Pathions
and their patterns of emanation, this distinction, while subtle, is obviously a crucial one.



                                              Page 17
           But this suggests the 7 interconnected Box-Kites of the 168-cell emanation tables
may be viewed in a similar manner, making their interconnectedness not hard to deal
with, but simple. Consider the first table's Assessor list given atop page 14: take the
lower-index items in the first of its two lines as given, and pick the leftmost value (2).
The two successive pairs that follow each complete a triple with it. Add in their 3 strut-
opposites on the right, and we've got the lower-index scheme for the first 3 Box-Kites:
(2, 4, 6, 7, 5, 3); (2, 8, 10, 11, 9, 3); (2, 12, 14, 15, 13, 3). Now move right, pick the (4),
and form 2 new triples with it from the left of the line; including opposites from the right
gives 2 more Box-Kites: (4, 8, 12, 13, 9, 5); (4, 10, 14, 15, 11, 5). Shift again, pick the
(6), perform the same trick: (6, 8, 14, 15, 9, 7); (6, 10, 12, 13, 11, 7).
          Parting thought anent "Mule-Trains": the attentive reader may already have fig-
ured out that if each <U+039E> -high (henceforth, "Sky-High") emanation table splits into 3 Box-
Kites, each with 2 sails based on one of the 7 overworked "Mule-Train" triplets, 7 x 3 x 2
= 42. The MT-Sails, then, play a role in Sky-Highs akin to the Sedenions' 42 Assessors
- or, perhaps more precisely, to the 42 inscriptions of the similarly "sterile" Octonions on
Box-Kite vertices therein. In this sense, each Sky-High's excluding but one Mule-Train
(the triplet completing the "green cell" pairings) is like the ban of the strut-constant Octo-
nions in the Sedenion context, which also act as "signatures." Is all this the beginning of
a "Jordan-Holder" sort of theory of lattice hierarchies in the ZD-Net? Tune in next
monograph, same text archive, same font of speculation, for the next exciting episode . . .

{3} Simulating "Creation Pressure" ( Cellular Automata Underneath Number?): In
the early days of neural networks, random Booleans operator values were strewn across
gate arrays, while researchers "watched what happened." Differently weighting different
levels of 2n -ions suggests itself, with further study of the harmonics and collapses, first in
evidence with the Pathions as just discussed, calling for a more programmatic approach.
The possibility of underwriting such a "ZD-net" with cellular-automata-like rules - and
hence, seeing Number itself as their side-effect in some deep senses - merits serious con-
sideration as well. Steve Wolfram's "Rule 30,"22 for instance - if a term and its right-
hand neighbor share a property, they switch its value to that held by the neighbor on their
left - might prove a good starting point in exploring "triplet-switch effects": for any As-
sessor, in any Sail, its lower-order (O, say) index will form a triplet with the other lower-
order indices in the same Sail; but it will also form a triplet with its adjacent Assessors'
higher-order (S or P, say) indices.
          Meanwhile, collapsing a Sky-High onto a Sedenion box-kite leaves all Assessors
properly indexed, but since the strut-opposite cell contents from which they were engen-
dered in the Pathions always have opposite edge-signs, their own edge-signs are left inde-
finite, and hence any interrupted cyclings may perhaps be left hanging (and vulnerable,
thereby, to "digression pressure") . . . at least for the moment of symmetry-breaking when
Pathions are "boiled off."
          Then too, kite-chain midden harmonics allow for ever greater "switching yard"
complexities as the n in 2n -ion gets bigger. What underlying restlessness of triplets, or
overarching "gantry-work" for growing n, might lead all these systems to "cross-pollin-
ate"? To what effect? By induction, and in conclusion, one can easily imagine things in
the general case getting wacky with alacrity. Where, then, one must wonder, might we
go with this?

    Moreno's formula is identical to that derived by Hurwitz in a superficially unrelated context: the
classification of compact Riemann surfaces of genus g > 2 have automorphism groups of size 84(g-1).
And, as the smallest order such group is a simple group, there is no Hurwitz group of order 84 - so the first
instance is analogous to the Pathion harmonic just described, while higher instances are no longer general!
(But indeed, even the Pathions' case isn't truly general either, as we'll see next section!) See Gareth A.

## Key Content

### Bit-String Recipe for ZD Construction

Extends the XOR master key to provide a complete "recipe" for constructing
all zero-divisor spaces in arbitrary 2^n-ions. The recipe is driven by
bit-string operations, making it amenable to computational enumeration.

### Infinite-Dimensional Extension

Shows that the kite-chain midden construction extends indefinitely, with
each doubling level adding a new layer of ZD structure. The "recipe" provides
a constructive proof that ZD patterns are self-similar across dimension
doublings.

### Key Results

- The bit-string recipe reproduces all known ZD structures for sedenions (16D)
  and pathions (32D) and predicts the structure for chingons (64D) and beyond.
- The construction is inherently recursive: ZDs in 2^{N+1}-ions are built
  from those in 2^N-ions by applying generator-based index transformations.
- The "carry-bit overflow" phenomenon (the source of ZDs beyond the octonions)
  is traceable through bit-string patterns, connecting to cellular automata.

## Key Contributions

### 1. XOR Master Key for Index Multiplication

The *product of two 2^N-ion units* has as *its index the XOR of the indices*
of the units producing it. Example: i_7 * i_12 = +/- i_{7 XOR 12} = +/- i_11.

This is the foundational rule for all Cayley-Dickson algebras. Signs (not
indices) are what require the complex machinery of production rules.

### 2. Trip Generation Rules

**Rule 0 (Inherited trips):** All associative triplets from prior CDP
generations remain valid in all higher 2^N-ions. The 7 octonion NATO
triplets (1,2,3); (1,4,5); (1,7,6); (2,4,6); (2,5,7); (3,4,7); (3,6,5)
persist in all higher dimensions.

**Rule 1 (Generator trips):** The generator **G** = 2^N (the unique unit of
index 2^N in the 2^{N+1}-ions) produces same-signed resultants for all units
on the same side of the comma. For each unit with index L < G, the CPO
trip is (L, G, G+L). This completely explains quaternion indexing and
produces 3 of the 7 new octonion trips from the single quaternion trip.

**Rule 2 (Swap rule):** From any Rule 0 trip, hold one index fixed, add G to
the other two, and *switch their positions*. For octonions with G=4,
fixing 1,2,3 in the quaternion trip (1,2,3): (1, 3+4, 2+4) = (1,7,6);
(3+4, 2, 1+4) = (7,2,5) -> CPO (2,5,7); (2+4, 1+4, 3) = (6,5,3) -> CPO (3,6,5).

### 3. Trip Count Formula

Total trips in 2^N-ions = (2^N - 1)(2^N - 2) / 3!

- Quaternions (N=2): 1
- Octonions (N=3): 7
- Sedenions (N=4): 35
- Pathions (N=5): 155
- Chingons (N=6): 651

### 4. Zero-Divisor Construction Rule

For primitive ZDs in sedenions: take one unit with index L < G (7 choices,
any octonion), pair with one unit with index U > G where U is *not* the XOR
of L with G (6 choices each). This gives 7 * 6 = 42 Assessors.

### 5. Box-Kite-to-Semiotic-Square Mapping (ZD-Net Hypothesis)

Five-step mapping between ZD structures and Greimas's Semiotic Square:
1. ZDs inhibit synonymy -> "meaning effects" from Sails and Box-Kites
2. Strut-opposites (which do NOT zero-divide) and their 4 units obey
   "XOR arithmetic" equivalent to the Semiotic Square
3. Sails contain non-ZD substructures: Q-copies (associative triplets)
   and their "Sailing partners"
4. "Trip Sync" property enables "message passing" between Zigzag Q-copies
   through shared Assessors in Trefoils
5. The simplest non-elementary Catastrophe form (Equilateral) underwriting
   "higher harmonics" of Box-Kite representation

### 6. N-Squares Norms and Bott Periodicity

The n-squares norm law for 2^N-ions: (N, N, N) for N <= 8.
For sedenions (N=4): the (16, 16, 32) rule (Hurwitz's "at worst").
For higher ions (N = 3+k >= 4): **(2^N, 2^N, 2^{N+k})** -- 8D modularity.
This is the "Bott periodicity" signature.

                                      ABSTRACT

The objects of the great Nonlinear Revolutions - Catastrophes and Chaos in the 1960s-
70s (henceforth, CT); and, "small-world" and "scale-free" Network Theory (NT), emerg-
ing from studies of synchronization since the Millennium - will be spliced together by a
New Kind of Number Theory, focused on digitizations (i.e., binary strings). NT nodes
then become "feature-rich" representations (nodules in a "rhizosphere") of CT contents.

The "Box-Kite" formalism of zero divisors (ZD's) - first showing in the 16-D Sedenions,
then in all higher 2N-ions derived from Imaginaries by Cayley-Dickson Process (CDP) -
can model such "enriched" nodules. Its (bit-string XOR-ing vs. matrix-multiplication-
based) operations unfold into "representations" of the objects traditionally linked with
"partitions of Nullity": Singularities. The route from this "local" level of CT to fractals
and Chaos, via CDP extensions to 2N-ions for growing N, will involve us in graphics of
higher-dimensional "carry-bit overflow," as manifest in the mandala-like patterns show-
ing up in "emanation tables" (the rough equivalent, for ZD's, of group theorists' Cayley
Tables). More concretely, this route will model semantic propagation - "meaning" itself.

I'll lead into this with a quote about "Hjelmslev's Net" (which I'll claim is the CDP man-
qu<U+00E9>) from a famous postmodern text deeply engaged with the philosophy of future mathe-
matics, Deleuze and Guattari's A Thousand Plateaus (where "rhizosphere" imagery
arose). From here, with strong assists from the CT-based structuralism of Jean Petitot,
Algirdas Greimas's "Semiotic Square" will show us how to explicitly link CT thinking to
the foundations of semantics via ZD "representations" (Part III), while the infinite-
dimensional ZD meta-fractal or "Sky" which Box-Kites fly "beneath" or "in" - first
appearing in the 32-D Pathions and incorporating the higher 2N-ions, and the theme of
Part II - will provide sufficient lebensraum for L<U+00E9>vi-Strauss's "Canonical Formula" of
mythwork to unfurl in, thereby doing for semiotics what S-matrix methods promised for
particle physics. (These results serve to extend my NKS 2004 paper, available online at
the Wolfram Science website.)
 0. Deep Background: Size vs. Place in the History of Number

       The ingenious method of expressing every possible number using a set of
       ten symbols (each symbol having a place value and an absolute value)
       emerged in India. The idea seems so simple nowadays that its significance
       and profound importance is no longer appreciated. Its simplicity lies in the
       way it facilitated calculation and placed arithmetic foremost amongst use-
       ful inventions. The importance of this invention is more readily appreci-
       ated when one considers that it was beyond the two greatest men of Anti-
       quity, Archimedes and Apollonius.

                           Pierre-Simon, Marquis de Laplace1

        From the vantage of traditional Number Theory, based on Quantity and Measure,
and a notion of "Natural" synonymous with indices of Counting, what could be more ex-
orbitant - etymologically, more "off the beaten path" - than basing Number, instead, on
the "XOR bit-dance" implicit in strings of binary toggle-switches? The notion of Zero
was unknown to the Greeks, among whom Number Theory first flourished. It reached the
West from China, via India, then Arabic North Africa, at the dawn of the Italian Renais-
sance, where the powerful utility of its "place-holder" thinking (especially when com-
pared to the clunkiness of Roman-numeral manipulations) impressed the new breed of
double-entry bookkeeping-savvy accountants - in particular, Leonardo of Pisa, son of an
Algerian trading post's director, best known by his nickname, Fibonacci. His Book of the
Abacus of 1202 introduced Hindu-Arabic computation, applying it to many concrete
situations (one of which, involving penned rabbits, led to the series since named for him).
        In his later, deeper but less famous Book of Squares, Fibonacci proved himself the
greatest Number Theorist between Diophantus of mid-3rd Century Alexandria and Pierre
de Fermat of 17th Century France. In particular, his extension of classical results concern-
ing Pythagorean triplets (integer sides of right triangles) led the way toward 3 great mod-
ern insights. First, Hilbert's generalization of what a metric is, in a geometry exceeding
(in a manner even more extreme than Descartes' algebraization anticipated) the 3-D limits
of Greek thinking: its summing an infinite number of squares (mediated by coordinates-
based right triangles), to yield one more (the square of the "distance"), is the bedrock of
classical Quantum Mechanics (QM). Second, by positing the uniqueness of squaring (as
opposed to cubing or other empowering) of integer trios, in the manner of the formula
ascribed to (but much older than) Pythagoras, Fermat's Last Theorem of 1630 presented
mathematicians with their most profound (yet simply statable) conundrum - one which
would trigger momentous developments like Kummer's theory of ideals, and serve (up
through the work of Andrew Wiles) as a guide to pure research for some four centuries.
But third, the number theoretics epitomized by Fibonacci's study of triplets finally ran
aground, in Hurwitz's Proof a century ago, when attempts to assimilate the second, "cal-
endrical" sense of Number as Cycle, to the "linear" notion based on Counting, came unra-
veled - when generalizations, that is, of the angular sense of exponentiation, typifying
Imaginary numbers in 2-D, broke down at last with their third dimension-doubling, by the
Cayley-Dickson Process (CDP), to the 16-D Sedenions . . . where the notion of
"distance" itself begins to totter, and Zero-Divisors appear "out of nowhere."

R. de Marrais                             Page 2                  "Presto! Digitization: I"
          In the domain of pure Number, the failure of metrics and emergence of zero-divi-
sors (ZD's) are joined together, but have their own flavors. There is a progressive break-
down of other properties at each dimension-doubling: the multiplicity of "sheets" associ-
ated by Riemann with equations over fields of Imaginary Number (a "parking garage"
with infinite levels for functions as fundamental as the logarithmic) is the immediate side-
effect of angular exponents, since there will always be an infinite number of angles with
the same value but different "winding number" (just add + 2<U+03C0>k, k any integer, to the
exponent's "angle"). In the 4-D Quaternions, we lose commutativity; with the 8-D Octo-
nions, we still have a "field," but it's no longer associative. With each of these losses of
structure, however, there are clear-cut gains in sensitivity: when equations are permitted
to have Complex solutions, the fundamental theorem of algebra - linking precisely N (not
necessarily distinct) solutions or "Zero's" with any Nth order polynomial - becomes al-
most trivial. With Quaternions, the vector calculus of "dot" and "cross" products Gibbs
extracted from them makes the intricacies of physical mechanics simple enough for col-
lege freshmen - with the "full Quaternion," meanwhile, serving to underwrite QM's angu-
lar momentum operators and Uncertainty relations, as well as the first nonlinear (and
"non-Abelian," hence at least Quaternionic) gauge theories.
         The 16-D loss of a metric has its benefits as well: I'll argue that, in fact, it pro-
vides the "natural" context within which we can think about the basic intuition of "small-
world" networks, wherein the "strength of weak ties"2 is paramount: for here, the key is
gauging relations not of kinship, but acquaintance -"six degrees of Kevin Bacon," not
closed systems of blood relationship. Hence, if "~" means "is acquainted with," we must
expect that if A ~ B and B ~ C, then C ~ A in general does not obtain, which is to say the
basis of a job-hunter's "networking" does not conform to a standard metric. The metrifi-
cation of 2N-ions, N < 4, is the straightforward result of their all deploying generalized
"Pythagorean squares" patterns: writing an arbitrary complex number as z = a + bi, and
another as z* = c + di, we take it for granted that the product of their absolute values is
the absolute value of their products (i.e., it "has a norm"); alternatively, writing things out
in terms of components, we get an extended sort of Pythagorean relationship between
squares: the product of one sum of N squares by another is a sum of N squares as well,
with N = 2, 4, or 8, for Complex, Quaternionic, or Octonionic Numbers respectively. In
the Complex case, this just means (ac - bd)2 + (ad + bc)2 = (a2 + b2)(c2 + d2).
         What Hurwitz showed in 1898 is that such patterns no longer work for N > 8. If,
using Rajwade's shorthand,3 we rewrite the rules just given to have form (N, N, N), where
the first two N's stand for the number of squares in the multiplied terms, and the final N
for those in their product, then the Sedenions conform "at worst" to the rule (16, 16, 32):
since 16 = 8 + 8, apply the Octonions' "8-squares" rule 4 times. ("At worst" means the
final index in parentheses, at the time Rajwade was writing, may be < 32, although it was
known at the time to be at least 29.) Indefinite redoubling yields a "worst case" rule (and
harbinger of infinite-dimensional ZD "meta-fractals" we'll call "skies") for 2N-ions, N =
(3 + k) > 4: (2N, 2N, 2N + k). This is a side-effect of "Bott periodicity," an 8-D modularity
found in countless arenas (e.g., Clifford algebras and cobordism theories) since Raoul
Bott first displayed it in more limited topological contexts. The keyword is modularity:
for ZD's arise simply in ring theory as soon as we consider finite rings, over integer do-
mains made from composites, not primes. Consider the integers modulo 6: 1 + 5 = 2 + 4
= 3 + 3 = 0, but 2 * 3 = 0 as well, making 2 and 3 "mutual ZD's" in this context.

R. de Marrais                              Page 3                   "Presto! Digitization: I"
          It was hardly obvious, though, that ZD's were an inevitable side-effect of the mod-
ularity of angular exponents. Gauss himself had assumed the Imaginary realm was the
"shadow of shadows" of an infinite hierarchy of higher entities. (The "composite" cha-
racter - not of 2N-ions for some high N, but of Complex Numbers themselves - was a
shock. Kummer's theory of ideals arose in response to the collapse of his "proof" of Fer-
mat's Last Theorem, which foundered on the non-unique nature of decomposing Complex
"number rings" into prime factors.) When plausible extensions of the Imaginary were
found to occur only in 2N dimensions, and - as Hamilton first showed with the failure of
the commutative law among Quaternions - further displayed surprising losses of just
those behaviors thought indispensable to any sane notion of Number, the suspicion that
things were not so simple as Gauss had supposed started growing, and eventually was
confirmed by Hurwitz - after which, CDP-generated hypercomplex numbers were dis-
carded as "pathological." (A situation highly reminiscent of that which Benoit Mandel-
brot found in analysis, whose "monsters" he turned into the "pets" we now call "fractals."
The connection between these, meanwhile, and the XOR-based "carry-bit overflow" that
characterizes progressive derivations of 2N-ions by CDP, will provide the bridge we need
between ZD's and "scale-free" - i.e., "fractal power-law" - networks.)
         And so the situation remained for exactly a century, until Guillermo Moreno's
1998 paper4 indicated ZD's conformed to some remarkably simple patterns (they span a
subspace of the Sedenions homomorphic to G2, the Octonions' automorphism group - a
result extensible, in turn, to all higher Number forms derived by CDP, since G2 was
known already to be the general 2N-ions' "derivation algebra" from 2N-1-ions). The dis-
covery, 2 years later, that ZD's obeyed rules of engagement most cleary displayed in the
workings of XOR relations between bit-strings - that is, by an NKS, not classical, sense
of what Number is - marked the first results of my own research. (In a twisted echo of N-
squares norms, we'll find our "master key" in this: the index of the product of two 2N-
ions is the XOR of their indices!) But the hundred years between Hurwitz and the new
interest in the "metric-free" ways of ZD's didn't see the problem dismissed so much as
displaced. As my argument hinges on this displacement, let's give it a special name.
         L<U+00E9>vi-Strauss has famously compared the structures of Baroque and Classical mu-
sic to those his analyses found in North and South American mythologies, explaining this
correspondence as a kind of "reincarnation."5 As the advent of printing presses and print-
specific modes of rational expression (viz., novels) replaced mythic narrative, the struc-
tures of the latter were reborn in new forms, in the "well-tempered'" modes of music we
associate with names like J. S. Bach, Haydn, and Mozart. With the advent of communica-
tions technology and electronic modes of broadcasting and conversing, a similar (but
oppositely directed) "reincarnation" can be indicated: the program killed by Hurwitz's
proof in mathematics is reborn, ensouled in the new body of structural linguistics.
         The genealogical derivation of Number Forms via CDP - which, starting with the
Real's fourth generation of "ancestor doubling" collectively dubbed Sedenions, seemed to
become fatally overrun with "monstrosities" - was paralleled, in work contemporary with
Hurwitz's (and the ultimate source of L<U+00E9>vi-Strauss's), by the beginnings of de Saussure's
structural analysis of linguistic signs. This quickly led to Louis Hjelmslev's "Net" of
indefinitely many strata, each housing a bifurcation into "form" and "substance" dichoto-
mies (etic vs emic, as in "phonetic" vs "phonemic"), later given a name in its own right by
Andr<U+00E9> Martinet: the indefinitely extensible process of "double articulation."6

 1. Hjelmslev's Net and Box-Kite Basics
        The semantic sieving by binaries called "Hjelmslev's Net," "whose minimal num-
ber" of successive distinctions "guarantees their maximal extension," starts with a split
into identically defined, arbitrarily named categories of expression line and content line
which "have mutual solidarity through the sign function."7 Deleuze and Guattari depict
this cascade of "reciprocal presuppositions" (Roman Jakobson's term for it) this way:

       Now this net had the advantage of breaking with the form-content duality,
       since there was a form of content no less than a form of expression.
       Hjelmslev's enemies saw this merely as a way of rebaptizing the discredit-
       ed notions of the signified and signifier, but something quite different was
       actually going on. Despite what Hjelmslev himself may have said, the net
       is not linguistic in scope or origin (the same must be said of double articu-
       lation: if language has a specificity of its own, as it most certainly does,
       that specificity consists neither in double articulation nor in Hjelmslev's
       net, which are general characteristics of the strata).8

         From here, the "structural semantics" of Algirdas Greimas' "Semiotic Square" will
show us how to link Catastrophe Theory to the foundations of semantics via ZD "repre-
sentations," with an assist from the researches of Jean Petitot, disciple of Greimas and
Ren<U+00E9> Thom both. But for those familiar with Deleuze's other writings, something of the
sort is already implicit in the quote above: for the term "strata" is in fact inspired by
Catastrophists' special use of it, and as such was the focus of an earlier work on Leibniz,
named after the simplest Catastrophe, The Fold. (And cited at length in numerous places
germane to our interests, by Petitot.9 Recall, too, it was Leibniz who adapted the ancient
Chinese scheme of "solid" and "broken" lines, in the 26 hexagrams of the I Ching, seed-
ing all later ideas of binary bit-strings!) This is made explicit in the authors' introduction
to "double articulation":

       God is a Lobster, or a double pincer, a double bind. Not only do strata
       come in at least pairs, but in a different way each stratum is double (it it-
       self has several layers). Each stratum exhibits phenomena constitutive of
       double articulation. Articulate twice, B-A, BA. This is not at all to say
       that the strata speak or are language based. Double articulation is so ex-
       tremely variable that we cannot begin with a general model, only a
       relatively simple case. The first articulation chooses or deducts, from un-
       stable particle-flows, metastable molecular or quasi-molecular units (sub-
       stances) upon which it imposes a statistical order of connections and
       successions (forms). The second articulation establishes functional, com-
       pact, stable structures (forms), and constructs the molar compounds in
       which these structures are simultaneously actualized (substances). In a
       geological stratum, for example, the first articulation is the process of
       "sedimentation," which deposits units of cyclic sediment according to a
       statistical order: flysch, with its succession of sandstone and schist. The
       second articulation is the "folding" that sets up a stable functional
       structure and effects the passage from sediment to sedimentary rock.10

          But how might ZD's relate to Catastrophes? Consider, first, in Catastrophe Theo-
ry, the simplest "compact" unfolding of a Singularity (meaning, no "tune in next time"
sendings to or from "infinity"- i.e., beyond the model's "local scoping") entails the split-
ting of a stable regime, or "attractor," into two. These may compete until capture of one
by the other, and exhibit paradoxical interplay en route (e.g., the "girl playing hard to get"
surrendering when her suitor gives up, or the "rat backed into a corner" jumping the
cat).11 But simply reverse the sign on the potential function which defines the "behavior"
associated with twiddling this Cusp's two "controls," and we get a "Dual Cusp," with two
unstable maxima ("mountain peaks" or "fountains," not "basins of attraction"), mediated
by a solitary zone of stability (instead of a compromise-inhibiting "zone of inaccessibili-
ty," necessitating the standard Cusp's trademark "jump"). This is the dynamics of a pan-
balance, which seesaws until the weights on its two arms are in equilibrium (a "measure-
ment" is obtained). Similarly, when two non-zero quantities have a Zero product, this
result can be interpreted in the manner of "pair production" from the far-from-empty QM
Void. In ZD's generated by CDP, a zero product of 2 of them isn't just "nothing," but a
pair of oppositely signed copies of a 3rd ZD, which always zero-divides the first 2's
"diagonal twins" (see next paragraph). If we use "~" to write "mutually zero-divides," we
can define an equivalence relation, peculiar to ZD's, upon which we'll construct an NKS
substitute for "Pythagorean triplets" (actually, "six-packs") using letters A - F.
         To preface a longer story with some shorthand, the letters stand for vertices of
special kinds of triangles, called Sails. Each letter further denotes a plane ("Assessor")
spanned by two imaginary axes, whose diagonals are saturated with (and in fact contain
all the "primitive") ZD's. 4 such Sails, joined only at 6 shared vertices, comprise half the
faces of an Octahedral vertex figure, or "Box-Kite" - a 3-D iconic shorthand for the 12-D
space ZD's really span! Its 4 "empty" triangles are Vents where "2N-ion winds" blow. If
we arbitrarily label one Sail's vertices A, B, C, and those of its opposite Vent F, E, D re-
spectively, then the 3 orthogonal lines AF, BE and CD demarcate "Struts": stabilizing
dowels made of wood or plastic in real-world Box-Kites.12 For all and only the vertex
pairs at opposite ends of a Strut, mutual ZD's don't exist. Along all 12 edges of the Box-
Kite, however, the "~" relation obtains between vertices, and indicates a binary selection
rule: if the edge is marked with a plus sign ("+") on the Box-Kite, then similarly oriented
diagonals at each vertex - both passing through the same 2 quadrants of their respective
planes ("/" for the {- -, ++} or "synchronized"13 line; "\" for the "anti-synchronized" or
{- +, + -} line) - are mutual ZD's . If marked with a minus sign ("-"), however, the
reverse obtains: a slash ("/") at either vertex mutually ZD's the other's backslash ("\").
         It is an invariant feature of Box-Kites that one Sail will have all 3 edges marked
"-", with its opposite Vent likewise having 3 "-" edge-signs, while all 6 remaining edges
are marked "+". By convention, the all-minus Sail, dubbed the "Zigzag," is labeled A, B,
C, making the all-minus Vent F, E, D. The Zigzag gets its name from contemplating the
sequence of diagonals joined in ZD pairings as one circuits its vertices: if we start with a
"/," then we get a 6-cyclic "double covering" of this sort: "/ \ / \ / \". The other 3 Sails,
with 2 "+" edges and 1 "-", do a double-circuit that suggests the under-over tracings of
the knots they're named for: Trefoils ("/ / / \ \ \"). The "3 + 1" logic of Trefoils vs Zigzag
will be seen to play a fundamental role in semantic models. To understand it, though, we
must now show where the XOR-ing of integer indices comes into play between edge- and
strut- joined vertices, and within the pairs of axial units forming planes at each.

R. de Marrais                              Page 6                  "Presto! Digitization: I"
          From an infinity of regular forms in low dimension (e.g., "polygons"), only tri-
angles and squares generalize to N-space (ergo, simplexes and "Cartesian coordinates").
Likewise, while there are many ways to represent "multiplication tables" of hypercomplex
numbers (2 for Quaternions: ij = k or ik = j; 480 for Octonions, labeled via 7 nodes and 7
arrows on the PSL(2,7) triangle; 100's of billions for Sedenions), only one scheme works
consistently, without anomalies, for all CDP 2N-ions. Index all 2N units by integers, from
0 (for "reals") to 2N - 1 (hence, up to 15 for Sedenions). The product of 2 such will have
as its index the XOR of the indices of the units producing it. A Sedenion "for instance"
is found in the triplet (7, 12, 11): that is, i7 * i12 = i[7 XOR 12] = i11.
         Signing of products is more involved; in fact, the anomalies it inevitably engen-
ders are what make ZD's possible! Signing is simple in one crucial instance: "adding a
bit to the left" to 2N-ions' indices effectively multiplies them "from the right," by the unit
indexed 2N - thereby generating 2N+1-ions. 2N hence is the "generator" (henceforth, G) for
the 2N+1-ions; within the latter, index XORing tells us that for k < G, ik * iG = + i(k + G) , and
oppositely for k > G. For all other indices, associative triplets (i.e., clones of Quaterni-
ons, or "Q-copies," with 7 in the Octonions, 35 in the Sedenions, and (2N - 1)(2N - 2)/6
for general 2N-ions) display conflicts between "signing" and "counting" order. This is
due to the "NKS effect" of iteratively adding bits via successive "G actions," N growing.
In an XOR-compliant writing of Octonion triplets, if the first 2 indices are in the order
that generates a "+" sign for the 3rd, then (1, 2, 3) - "i, j, k" indices for standard Quater-
nions - have "sign ordering" identical to "counting order" as shown; ditto, for (1, 4, 5);
(2, 4, 6); (2, 5, 7); and (3, 4, 7). But the 2 remaining triplets, if written to show "sign
ordering," must necessarily violate "counting order": (1, 7, 6) and (3, 6, 5). And while it
is possible to fiddle with labeling schemes to reduce the number of such "out-of-sync"
triplets to 1, one can never expunge them entirely: there is always a bump in the rug.
And, starting with the Sedenions (viz., the (7, 12, 11) triplet cited last paragraph), such
bumps will clash in such a manner as to mandate the existence of Zero-Divisors.
         Corollarily, such ZD's will never involve products including the perfectly behaved
G. This leads to a surprisingly simple rule for finding all the "primitive" ZD's in the Se-
denions: take one unit whose index, L, is less than G, then take another whose index U
exceeds it, and does not equal the XOR of G with L (equivalent to saying, in this special
case, it doesn't equal G + L). For any of the 7 choices of L, there are then 6 choices left
for U, such that the plane they span (one of the 7 * 6 = 42 "Assessors") will have diago-
nals of the form k * ( iL + iU ), k real, all of whose points are ZD's. Put another way, point
coordinates on these lines (hence, k values) are irrelevant, ergo arbitrary: ZD's are there-
fore best thought of as line elements - meaning they, like NKS entities generally, as Wol-
fram has argued the case, have an inherent randomness built into their workings.14
         This rule (with restrictions due to "carry-bit overflow") generalizes for higher 2N-
ions; the point of moment, for present purposes, is that Sedenions partition into 7 Box-
Kites, each housing 6 Assessors, each of which forms ZD's only within the 2 Sails sharing
its vertex in its Box-Kite. This is the concrete manifestation of Moreno's abstract "G2
homomorphism": since G2 symmetry is either 14-fold (when the subscripted "2" - for the
count of unit vectors spanning the space containing its dozen "roots" - is included, as
when particle physicists calculate symmetries), or 12-fold (as in coding theory or kaleido-
scope building), the simplest homomorphism to contain both possibilities has an 84 count
- the number, precisely, of ZD-saturated lines, when tallying across all 7 Box-Kites.15

 2. "Greimas's Glitch" and the ZD-Net Hypothesis
        Although this may seem like reaching on a first reading, the last few paragraphs
set up the second resonance between ZD's and the fundaments of semantics. The first, of
course, was the suggestive analogy between the nonstop redoubling of Hjelmslev's Net
and the Cayley-Dickson Process. The second, though, is readily made by those who
know what to look for: for the dyadic nature of ZD's - each comprised of two indecom-
posable "units," one with index less than the generator G, one with index greater, which
is a formal way of saying they inhere in different analytic "levels"- is just what Algirdas
Greimas tells us is called for to resolve the most deep-set contradiction in the classical
structuralist agenda. "Greimas's Glitch," as I like to think of it, can be depicted thus.
        Once upon a time, there was a fundamental epistemological problem in Saussur-
ean signification theory. It was celebrated in all its na<U+00EF>vet<U+00E9> on the cover of the Winter '72
issue of the postmodernist review Diacritics, which displayed a picture of the wrapper
from a then-new candy from Peter Paul, a peanut-butter bar called "No Jelly." This was
meant to be juxtaposed with a lift from a text of near-scriptural status, Ferdinand de Saus-
sure's Course in General Linguistics, printed on the inner back cover: "In language there
are only differences. Even more important: a difference generally implies positive terms
between which the difference is set up; but in language there are only differences without
positive terms." (This number became famous for other reasons, too: it contained the
first major English interview with deconstructionist Jacques Derrida - one of whose prin-
cipal targets, of course, was the ensemble of de Saussure's unexamined assumptions!)
        The credo of pure arbitrariness in signs (any random signifier could, in theory, be
linked to any random signified) meant their patterns of mutual difference alone made sig-
nifying thinkable - which made the existence of synonyms and their generalizations a
problem. Greimas used the "double articulation" agenda initiated by Hjelmslev to posit a
way out of this embarrassment: assume two "pieces" of a signifying complex reside at
different strata, so that they essentially could work together when combined with another
such complex to yield a "zero" (hence, synonym effect) in semantic difference. (Think
non-message bits in a self-correcting error code.) This point is too far-reaching not to in-
stantiate it: in Structural Semantics, Greimas gives as example the "synonymous" mor-
phological marks "-s" and "-en," for designating plurals ("cows" vs "oxen") in English.
These different marks can cover identical elements of content, "on the condition, how-
ever, of having different contextual distributions."

       It is consequently sufficient that a mark be realized twice, at two different
       structural levels - the first time under the form of the opposition of phon-
       emes, the second time, under the form of the opposition of phonematic
       segments - for the differentiating effect of the first mark to be canceled by
       the advent of the second differential gap. Thus in some conditions two
       marks can be neutralized by combining with each other:

                                      X+(-X)=0

       and redundant variation on the plane of expression does not provoke any
       difference of signification. Thus synonymy is possible.16


R. de Marrais                              Page 8                  "Presto! Digitization: I"
          Thus, whatever other significances we may attribute to it, Zero here indicates a
state of "no difference" between semantic contents, and hence a redundancy which con-
text may frame as lack or ambiguity of meaning, but which change of context may con-
vert into a bifurcation of possibly intended senses, as with puns, jokes, and ironic state-
ments - with the affect responses these can induce being minimally modeled by standard
Cusps (whose nonlinear "jumps" in such cases, between the attractors competing to be
"taken seriously" by us, are frequently flagged by sudden bursts of laughter).17
         Primitively speaking, potential meaning is linked with potential for affect release
- the "Aha!" experience, that is, contains the gist of "making sense." But we also know
two other things. First, "level-jumping" is indigenous not just to specific "meaning expe-
riences," but has a volatility independent of any such instances, which allows us to navi-
gate between "candidates" for meaningfulness with a freedom verging on infinite: in a
slogan, anything can be quoted or pointed at ("That!"). Such pronominal "pointing"
serves precisely to fulfill its own name: any phenomenon, however complex and hence
needful of enormous numbers of dimensions to be modeled, can be magically shrunk to a
point - with the reverse mountain-from-molehill process, of course, obtaining ("point
well taken!") just as naturally. Derrida calls this "iterability," noting that "Every sign,
linguistic or nonlinguistic" is amenable to citing/sighting/siting/inciting us to insight:
"This citationality, duplication, or duplicity, this iterability of the mark," he tells us, "is
not an accident or anomaly, but is that (normal/abnormal) without which a mark could no
longer even have a so-called 'normal' functioning."18
         What this means for our ambitions here is that our modeling must have built-in
"open-ended-ness," with the indefinite extensibility of 2N-ions as its vehicle. We will
ultimately need means for collapsing high-order ensembles into "points" - and not just
means, but motives: there must, that is, be mechanisms indigenous to our models which
enable "explosions" of insight-flashes into epics. (Poincar<U+00E9> puts his foot on the bus, and
sees in a flash how his Fuchsian groups' transformations can "provide transportation" for
hyperbolic geometry as well!)19 Before we can even consider what that might require,
however, let's note that its fulfillment must contradict the basic assumptions which but-
tress up our choice of where to start from - which leads me to the second "other thing"
referenced in the paragraph before the citation. 2N-ions offer us structural alternatives
extending far beyond the limits of "Bott periodicity"; but the Catastrophist's toolkit is
"local" in the extreme, with the "elementary" theory being heavily constrained by the 8-D
"Bott limit": "new tricks" stop with the 8-D end of the 3-term E series of singularities.
         A famous conundrum, in fact, with implications for all finite mathematical classi-
fications, had its origins in this very domain. I refer to Vladimir Arnol'd's 1972 "A, D, E
Problem,"20 which showed the taxonomy of local singularities Catastrophes provide in
fact complies, at a meta-level, with countless other schemes, shorthanded by the "ball-
and-stick" drawings physicists call "Dynkin Diagrams," and algebraists interested in fi-
nite reflection groups (a.k.a. kaleidoscopes) know by Coxeter's name. In this setting, the
trivial accelerated object in a gravitational potential, the simple Fold of sudden starts and
ends, the doubly complex (but still quite simple) Cusp, are just the three lowest forms on
the infinite "totem pole" of "An" type, with n = 1, 2, 3 respectively. But as the guy paint-
ing the street meridian put it in "Chafed Elbows," "You have to draw the line someplace"
- and this will be where we draw ours to start with. (Merging this "starter kit" into NT's
fractal "Big Picture" will concern us later - and indeed, is a key target.)

R. de Marrais                              Page 9                   "Presto! Digitization: I"
         Let's start, then, by noting that if Zero-Divisors can indeed serve as markers to
indicate a lack of difference (or, dually, an ambiguous "balancing act") between two
meanings, in what manner can they facilitate a basis for locking a meaning in place?
Corollarily, if simple Catastrophe models can underwrite simple "meaning effects," in
what sense do ZD's and these models intersect? As a first pass at an answer, let's posit
the following five-step "ZD-Net Hypothesis":

   1. Since ZD's seem, in some primary way, to facilitate synonymy (and hence inhibit
      individuation of significance), the most fundamental "meaning effects" should de-
      volve upon just those substructures of ZD ensembles - "Sails" and "Box-Kites"
      and (starting with the 32-D Pathions) multiple-Box-Kite synergies - wherein ZD's
      are not acting "as such."
   2. The most basic ZD objects which don't act as such are "Strut-opposites": only
      oppositely placed Assessors on a Box-Kite do not mutually zero-divide, and their
      4 units obey an "XOR arithmetic" equivalent to the logic of Greimas' "Semiotic
      Square" (SS). As Petitot makes the case that the SS, a fundamental "crossing" of
      two semantic polarities, can be approached as the simplest "stacking" interaction
      of two simple 2-Control Cusps (which is to say, in terms of the fifth term and its
      dual in the A series, one simple 4-Control Butterfly), this implies the standard and
      dual A5 can be "represented" by "Strut logic," with the horizontal, diagonal and
      vertical paths on the SS corresponding to its invariant features (Strut Constant
      "S," Generator "G", and their XOR "X", not necessarily in that order).
   3. Sails contain substructures which are not zero-divisors: the "L" units (indices <
      G) of each Assessor in a Sail form a Q-copy; but each also forms a Q-copy with
      the "U" units (indices > G) of its two "Sailing partners." For the Zigzag ABC, we
      can write these this way: {a, b, c}; {a, B, C}; {A, b, C}; {A, B, c}. The same ob-
      tains for Trefoils, but the subtle "Trip Sync" property says that "bow-tie flows"
      (akin to Greimas' "figure-8's") through their shared Assessor, from one Zigzag Q-
      copy to another in a Trefoil, allow for a special kind of D-series "message pas-
      sing." This process also permits an interpretation of a second SS reading, favored
      by American postmodernists, and (due to his claiming an isomorphism between
      his Square and the Klein Group) sanctioned by Greimas himself.
   4. The eliciting of Tests and Helpers and their interrelationships are the hallmark of
      Greimas' analysis of Vladimir Propp's study of Russian wondertales (the study
      from which the SS construct emerged). As Greimas points out, there are 3 of each
      in any such tales' architecture, and this can be related to the 3 Struts (and 3 "Trip
      Sync" message-pass setups, one per Trefoil) in a Box-Kite. The "contract," mean-
      while, which enables the tale as a whole, can be associated with the ZD-free Q-
      copy with units indexed by S, G, X and 0 (the real unit) - what a C++ or Java pro-
      grammer would call an "abstract class," which the tale's unfolding instantiates.
   5. The simplest CT object which incorporates all the above is also the simplest "non-
      elementary" Catastrophic form - one rigorously related by Arnol'd's school to the
      Equilateral among the 3 "primordial triangles" in Plato's Timaeus.21 (The other 2
      underwrite "higher harmonics" of Box-Kite representation, thanks to which the
      pathway to NT embeddings via higher 2N-ion cascading is opened to our inquiry.)

 3. Semiotic Squares and "Eco Echo"
        The Italian writer Umberto Eco is best known for his novels - one of which, The
Name of the Rose, was made into a highly successful Sean Connery vehicle. But he is
also a major European academic, and one of the world's pre-eminent semioticians. In his
best-known scholarly text, he's noted a fundamental difficulty in the enterprise of nailing
down the "basics" of what meaning is, which will be referenced herein as "Eco echo":

       as soon as the semantic universals are reduced in number and made more
       comprehensive ... they become unable to mark the difference between
       different sememes. And as soon as their number is augmented and their
       capacity for individuation grows, they become ad hoc definitions.... The
       real problem is that every semantic unit used in order to analyze a sememe
       is in its turn a sememe to be analyzed.22

        The problem is rendered far less paradoxical by seeing semantics as side-effect of
a mathematical substrate (one of the primary motivations for representing fields of know-
ledge as mathematical "sciences" in the first place!). Yet "Eco echo" still has a residuum
of "Cheshire cat's smile" adhering to it, which must be somehow addressed in the mathe-
matical apparatus we put in place. Complementary to Derrida's "iterability," "Eco echo-
ing" requires that we at least treat the 3 distinct binary categories of relationship which
constitute the Semiotic Square as having a protean nature, which double articulation can
underwrite (and find, within this process, its own impetus). Relations represented by SS
verticals (perhaps strut-constant "S" values in Box-Kite talk) can, in other SS's serving
other purposes, appear as horizontals (hence, G xor S = G + S = "X" values), or even as
diagonals (generators themselves, once "relabeling schemes" are allowed) in others.
        Allied with such conversions are fundamental patterns of "explosion," the simp-
lest of which show how G, S, and X patterns among Sedenion Box-Kites can be mapped
to ensemble effects in the 32-D Pathions' various septets (7 "Pl<U+00E9>iades" plus the "Atlas" or
"Muster Master") and triads (the 7 "sand mandalas") of Box-Kites - which we'll express
as special "blow-ups" along S, G and X pathways, with each having its own somewhat
surprising properties. As the aim here is to be illustrative rather than exhaustive, we'll be
providing exemplifications of patterns amenable to greater generalization, rather than
anything like an "axiomatics." (We will later, when we speak of higher-order "semical
harmonics" of Box-Kite representational analysis, consider ways in which SS's them-
selves can be seen as "lines" within "meta-SS" diagrams - but again, our aim will be to
introduce, not exhaust, such topics, which are after all still in their infancy as research
themes, yet should be taken as candidates for indefinite induction anyway.)
        This much said, some "buffer refresh," via a new Box-Kite diagram and ancillary
tables of index patterns, is next, with attention directed initially to peculiarities obtaining
between Strut-Opposite dyads (as well as between the diagonals within a single Assessor
at either end of such a dyad). In the diagram, uppercase demarcates indices > G; lower-
case, those less. A, B, C mark the Zigzag (on top), and D, E, F the Vent opposite it, with
the negative edge-signs framing them drawn in red ink to make a Star of David (with the
outer hexagon of positive edge-signs in blue). Zigzag ABC, and Trefoils ADE, FDB and
FCE, are painted moon-silver, blood-red, sun-yellow and sky-blue, respectively.

         Note that, in this way of rendering the Box-Kite, the products of the lowercase
letters joining vertices along the outer blue hexagon have sign-orders that are always
positive when tracing a counterclockwise path: for strut constant 1, for instance, a*d =
3*4 = + 7, the e at the ADE Trefoil's 3rd vertex. But now observe that the reverse is the
case for products of UPPERCASE letters along the same paths: A*D = 10*13 = -7, the e
with reversed sign this time (e and not E, since the high bits are XOR'd away). For the
edges in red along the Star of David, abc and ABC products are positive along counter-
clockwise pathways, while def and DEF are positive along clockwise. (See BK4 for a
brief explanation and proof.) This is the basis of the "Trip Sync" property alluded to
above: "slippage" is allowed from one Q-copy to the other sharing a lowercase index if it
belongs to the Zigzag (equivalent to saying, as we'll be seeing, that exchanges along an X
path in a Semiotic Square are "free"). Otherwise, a "quantum of spin" (or orientation re-
versal) will result. In the uniquely "all red-edged" Zigzag Sail, such slippage is always
unobservable in this context. (The importance of this will become clear once we translate
Strut Opposites' multiplicative patterns into SS language. "Slip spin" reverses relations 2
Squares share, in a way involving D-series Catastrophes - with "meaning effects" involv-
ing Greimas' trio of "Helpers," enabling one SS "hand" to "wash the other.")
         A "/" or "\" times itself, at any vertex, is some scalar times the negative real unit.
The product of "/" and "\," in the same Assessor plane, is + a scalar times X ( = G + S).
Next in complexity are Strut-Opposite products: writing (V, v) and (Z, z) for "def" Vent
and Zigzag Assessors which straddle a Strut, the rules are just V * Z = v * z = S; Z * v =
V * z = G; Z * z = v * V = X. But to which of the Semiotic Square's 4 corners (yielding
4! = 24 choices) should each go? And which arrow-types should be labeled G, S and X?
(6 more choices!) Might the answers to these questions depend, to some extent, upon the
specifics you wish to elicit? It would do to describe the 3 path types in classic Jakobson-
Greimas language, then try out a couple of mappings while watching what happens . . .
but first, let's come at things from the other side of our overriding comparative urge, and
derive the Square's own context by an iterative process - CDP-driven "double articula-
tion" of the Reals - then (per Wolfram's mantra) "watch what happens."
         To inaugurate that last exercise, an initial setup should suggest itself: the indefi-
nitely extensible morass of ZD's, caught up in Flows beyond the confines of metrics, can
be thought of as the "sediment" of the first Deleuzian articulation; the Lie-algebraic "ele-
mentary taxonomies" conforming to "A-D-E" diagrams provide the Forms, or "sedimen-
tary rock" of the second. We could call the latter "belonging structures," and the former
"meaningful flows" - carriers of the shapes and colors Hjelmslev's Net goes fishing for.

R. de Marrais                              Page 12                  "Presto! Digitization: I"
          If you've been reading the discursive footnotes (especially 15, and 19-21), or are
familiar with the literature on "A-D-E" already, then you know that this divide between
Forms and Flows is hardly arbitrary. All Forms are positive-curvature bound, which is
how the McKay Correspondence is literally able, by projection from SU(2)'s 4-space to
the 3-D sphere Plato himself knew, to map polygons to the A-series, dihedra (polygons
colored on both sides) to the D, and the E-series to the 3 symmetries underlying the 5
regular solids (with cubes and octahedra, and icosa- and dodeca- hedra, being "duals" of
each other, such that the vertex figure of either maps to the faces of the other). The "pri-
mordial triangles" of interest to us, per the fifth part of the ZD-Net Hypothesis, form a
thin "boundary layer" of "flat" or "Euclidean" curvature, containing - in a dimension-
reversing sense topologists should feel at home with - the 3 Platonic Solids as maximal
strata: the equilateral triangle, the tetrahedron (E6); the right isosceles, the Box-Kite's
octahedron (E7); the 30-60-90, the icosahedron (with "closest packing" of 8D spheres
mapped by Octonionic loops of 240 "integral Cayley numbers," the E8 "root count").
         These are also the cross-sections of the 3 prismatic kaleidoscopes one can build
with 3 mirrors (one for each of the "Timaeus" singularities' behavior variables - and, in
particular, one for each Strut in our Box-Kite). These singularities are all "non-elemen-
tary," which is to say they have "parameters" which measure the breakdown of the link
between topology and differentiability - which mysterious variables, based upon projec-
tive invariants (e.g., perspective's cross-ratio for the non-Equilaterals), are rendered pal-
pable and even prosaic by prismatic scoping: instead of a single center of symmetry, as in
the standard 6-fold kid's symmetry-maker, you get honeycombs tessellated by the triangle
in question, with as many centers as your viewing aperture will let you take a peek at.
This "modularity" (related, but not identical, to the notion of that name we talked about at
the outset) is linked to certain critical values which, when hit upon, cause "explosions"
into infinite-dimensional "control spaces" - just the sort of impetus our discussion of
"iterability," at the start of last section, said we'd be needing.
         But needing for what, exactly? For throwing our Net into the negative-curvature
spaces of higher-dimension reaches, where Chaotic "period-doubling" and other modes of
turbulence hold forth. The non-elementary figures of what Form-like patterns exist there
are all related, as Dolgachev showed, to M. C. Escher's world of hyperbolic tilings - and,
as Jacques Hadamard first pointed out in the year of Hurwitz's Proof, such spaces of
negative curvature are generally divergent (in senses that Poincar<U+00E9>'s then-ongoing efforts
were just making discussable).23 Add to this, the seemingly gratuitous fact that James
Callahan, in his now-classic multi-dimensional navigations of E6 and Double Cusp Cata-
strophes using stacked 2- and 3-D "tableaus," has found marvelous defining features he
calls "trance tunnels" and "ship's prows," through and with which one "steers" in "control
space," by use of "keels" and other sailing instruments.24 Now imagine our flat boundary
layer of "Timaeus triangle" unfoldings to be akin to the surface of deep waters plied by
fishing trawlers - with the fishermen throwing out seines we've come to call by Hjelm-
slev's monicker. Then imagine the sea across which we're sailing to be a "sentient
ocean," like that covering the surface of Stanislav Lem's Solaris. In the sci-fi classic, this
realm of Meaningful Flows can respond to our most secret wishes and thoughts with in-
stantly realizable architectural (and even sensual) manifestations. Something of the sort
is what we hope will be in store for us, as we begin to cast our net for Semiotic Squares
and other "deep-sea creatures," in higher-dimensional Zero-Divisor spaces.

 4. Struts, Tray-Racks, and Twisted Sisters: Bounding the Model from Above
         Let's start with the usual "assume true" of so many mathematical proofs. Assume
it's the case, that is, that a Strut is a showcase for Semiotic Squares, as claimed. Let's
look simple-mindedly at what that means geometrically. On the vertex net we've called a
Box-Kite, the 3 mutually orthogonal Struts are themselves diagonal lines - 2 at a time in
each of the 3 mutually orthogonal Squares whose perimeters contain all 12 Box-Kite
edges. So we immediately see that the context in which we claim the Semiotic Square
should be housed has another level of "double articulation" already enabled. These doub-
led-up SS's, or "Tray-Racks" - named for those portable, snap-together-fast make-shift
table-tops, so perfect for holding TV dinners while your attention's focused on something
else - can have their perimeters traced in the manner of Sails. But aside from the obvious
4- vs. 3- fold symmetry, there's at least one other very big difference: since the edge-
signs regularly alternate from plus to minus as you circuit, there is no double covering;
instead, one has two distinct circuits which never intersect, each "making zero" with each
of the 4 Assessors through which it threads. But where one Tray-Rack does so with the
slash, the other does its drive-by at the same site with the backslash.
         There is also a double articulation of product outcomes: in Sails, the 3rd vertex
has "pair production" of its contents result from multiplication of the other two. With
Tray-Racks, each edge belongs to a different Sail, but a sort of "pair production" still re-
sults - with a "twist." In fact, in BK1, I called this second kind of multiplication just that:
a "twist product." The ways in which it "double articulates" are best explained by
defining it: if (iU + iL)(iU* + iL*) = 0, then (iU + iL*)(iU* - iL) does, too. (I leave off the te-
dious variations based on internal signing.) What we have, then, is a swapping rule: a
same-case-indexed unit of one partner in a mutual ZD pair is swapped for the correspond-
ing unit in the other, with the resultant ZD pairings having edge-signs toggled. (More,
just as in SS's, horizontal and vertical edges have different behaviors, with parallels of
one type "twisting" in tandem to opposite-type parallels on different Tray-Racks.) The
edge in question, meanwhile, is in a different Box-Kite - although, as we'll clarify next,
the Sail containing this alien edge is in the same Loop as the Sail we started with.
         The divide between Loop and Box-Kite, in fact, is the basis of this "double articu-
lation" effect. Loops are just the non-associative algebraist's next best thing to Groups,
and Raoul Cawagas, after but independently of me, also eked out the patterns of ZD's in
the Sedenions, via the Loop-studying software he'd designed for just such purposes.25
Except his 7 hitherto undiscovered 16-element Loops (ZD-harboring clones of Octonions,
which - being uninterested in Loop theory at the time of BK1 - I'd simply given the silly
name of "automorphemes," when I wasn't just referring to them as "Moreno counter-
feits") partition into 4 subsystems, corresponding to Sails. These Loops, then, and my
Box-Kites, are duals: each Box-Kite's 4 Sails inhabit different Cawagas 16-Loops, and
vice-versa. Moreover, the patterns governing this duality are exceedingly orderly, and
can be catalogued with PSL(2,7) triangles I call "Twisted Sisters" diagrams, whose 7
nodes house the Strut Constants of the Box-Kites engaged in "swappings," while edges
have color-coded segments (one per each Tray-Rack) to flag in- and out- going matchups.
         As the phenomena just limned serve to bound our SS modeling "from above,"
let's stop to take a look at what's just been sketched out so hurriedly. (Later arguments
about higher "semical harmonics" will require, after all, some familiarity with such mat-
ters.) First, let's look at twist products, from one Tray-Rack to each of two others.

R. de Marrais                                Page 14                   "Presto! Digitization: I"
         To see the orderliness of the Twist, a standard presentation of the Tray-Rack is
needed. Regardless of Box-Kite, all 3 Tray-Racks share a structural invariance: unlike
the 4 Sails, which display a "3+1" symmetry between Trefoils and Zigzag in their cycling
patterns, each Tray-Rack displays a "3+1" in the orientation of ZD flows. Adopting an
"overtone series" convention that low bits are less volatile, hence less subject to move-
ment, we use them as points of reference.26 In each Tray-Rack, the orientation of L-bit
products is counterclockwise along 3 successive sides, with the 4th (with negative edge-
sign) showing a clockwise reversal. If we label them with the letters of the struts perpen-
dicular to them in the octahedron, Tray-Racks AF, BE, CD have reversed edges DE, FD,
EF respectively, each of which belongs to a Trefoil completed by the perpendicular's
Zigzag Assessor. (The "3+1" of Sails and Tray-Racks hence share the same source.)
Rotate their frames so that the top edge and the projection of the perpendicular on the
square's center define this Trefoil, and paint it in traffic-light colors: red, yellow, or
green for Tray-Racks labeled AF, BE, or CD. Call such presentations "Royal Hunt"
diagrams, after the 5th line text of I Ching Hexagram 8, "Holding Together": "In the hunt,
the king uses beaters on three sides only and foregoes game that runs off in front."
        The vertical lines, if twisted together (a "V*" operation), produce a Tray-Rack in
another Box-Kite, and likewise for the horizontals ("H*"). Further, performing H* or V*
twice is isomorphic to the workings of an associative triplet, indexed by the 3 Strut Con-
stants of the Tray-Racks' Box-Kites. Since twist results can be written in 2 different or-
ders, depending on whether the L or U units are swapped left to right, a convention to
minimize rewriting and maximize consistency is adopted: for top and left edges in "Roy-
al Hunt" setup, L's are swapped and U's held in place; for bottom and right edges, U's
are swapped and L's fixed. When this procedure is followed, H* produces a Tray-Rack
rotated 90o clockwise of "Royal Hunt," while V* produces one rotated an equal but oppo-
site amount. Depicted below are 2 of the 3 twist product sets for the S=3 Box-Kite.

         In general, the S of the Box-Kite we twist to, is easily shown to always equal the
index of the perpendicular's Vent Assessor, in the Tray-Rack twisted from. In the parti-
cular cases just shown, the S-triple (1,2,3) for Box-Kite 3 indicates all Tray-Racks are of
the same AF variety: this is unique to the "true" Quaternion index set, and explains the
central red circle in the "Twisted Sisters" diagram. The "Royal Hunt" sequence for the
same Box-Kite's BE Tray-Rack, by contrast, requires all 3 colors for its (3, 6, 5), as do
most S-triples. Since Strut Constants for 2N-ions are always less than 2N-1, the Sedenions'
"Twisted Sisters" diagram has '4' (i.e., the Octonions' 'G') in the center, where it plays a
role opposite the one it adopts with index multiplication: as symmetry breaker (viz., 347
and 246's 2-coloring, 145's color ordering). All other paths are quite regular. We've
seen the "inner circle" of Quaternion indices forms an all-red circle of clockwise flows.
The nodes at medians point inwards with green; yellows point into the vertices. The
clockwise flowing on the perimeter always leaves a node with green, passes through yel-
low, then comes to a stop at its terminus with red (the "traffic light" sequence).
        Such PSL(2,7)-based diagrams exist in the Pathions as well, shown in BK4 by the
"Stereo Fano" synergies of paired PSL(2,7)'s shorthanding the layout of the 14-Assessor,
7-Box-Kite ensembles (7 Pl<U+00E9>iades plus the "Atlas"), and can serve to refine the classify-
ing of Box-Kites, now that the Strut Constant proves no longer unique, hence too coarse.
                                       We will not be concerned with them here, but we
                                       will care about the general phenomenon of studying
                                       structures like Sails and Tray-Racks which thread
                                       ZD's, and which we'll refer to in the abstract as
                                       "lanyards" - those strands of leather, string or plastic
                                       upon which charms or beads are queued, to make
                                       closed loops of jewelry. They roughly do service in
                                       ZD work comparable to what Groups, built on '1'
                                       and notions of Identity, do in standard algebra and
                                       number theory. Informally, lanyards are linked lists
                                       such that each diagonal of each Assessor threaded is
                                       left-multiplied to make zero once only, with closure.
The Sail is a doubly linked list, with all diagonals in the 3 Assessors visited being thread-
ed in one 6-cycle; Tray-Racks, also doubly linked, only provide single covering, hence
come in pairs, each cover threading half the diagonals without intersecting the other.
        Two more lanyards are highly significant: the Quincunx threads 5 Assessors, and
can be interpreted as a strategy to go around the obstacle to traffic flow the top edge of a
"Royal Hunt" diagram represents: by detouring up the Strut perpendicular to the Tray-
Rack, then coming back to the endpoint of the bypassed segment, a 10-cycle double cov-
ering can be achieved without "going against the flow" of the natural "L-bit" orientation.
A doubly astonishing connection exists between the symmetry of choices available and
the icosahedral reflection group: doubly so, as the connection of the "obstacle bypass"
problem in Singularity Theory to this same group caused a big to-do when members of
Arnol'd's circle discovered it (then heard, as well, that diagrams of the wavefront indicat-
ing this symmetry had appeared in the first-ever analysis text by l'H<U+00F4>pital, who likely de-
rived them ultimately from Huyghens himself!).27 Finally, all12 diagonals are threaded
by the polyrhythmic "Bicycle Chain" of <U+00BE>-Tray-Rack scans, linked by "-"-edge jumps:
an inviting candidate for NKS-style simulation work - about which, more toward the end.

 5. First Pass at the Model, and the Route to Fractals
         The correspondence of Semiotic Squares as modeled by ZD subsystems with the
CT treatment of Petitot is further reinforced by the fact that the "ceiling" of our approach,
as indicated by the just-discussed Tray-Rack-based "swapping" problem twist products
handle, is also at a level above his SS model. As an index of the limits of CT modeling
itself, one must employ the highest one-behavior stratum of the Double Cusp, the A7
"Star," to effect such bartering - and even then, the result is not quite satisfying!28
         This shared "bounding from above" of both ZD-based and Petitot models is un-
derscored by the Tray-Rack's relationship to the second (right isosceles) "Timaeus Tri-
angle," and hence the Double Cusp, whose "extended Dynkin diagram" is a box whose 4
corners house "basins of attraction" separated by saddles on their edges, and joined by
diagonals which cross in a mountainous "maximum" (and whose so-called "generic sec-
tion" in Control Space is the 4-cusped curvilinear square known as an "Astroid").29 But
do we truly need 16-D to contextualize both? We'll want to consider how the models are
jointly "bounded from below." But to do so, we need an initial presentation of our own,
in Greimas's terms.
         To begin at the beginning: in Greimas's Structural Semantics, whose analysis of
Propp's wondertale morphology led directly to the SS diagram, Greimas asks us what, on
the linguistic plane, we mean when we say we "perceive differences"? He answers his
own question in a doubly articulated fashion:

           1. To perceive differences means to grasp at least two object-terms as
       simultaneously present.
           2. To perceive differences means to grasp the relationship between the
       terms, to link them together somehow.30

        We are next told that "simultaneous grasping" implies its own dyad: first, one ob-
ject alone doesn't carry signification; second, this perceiving together implies both some-
thing shared between them (the "problem of resemblance") and (in order to discern there
are, indeed, two or more of them) something somehow different, which serves to distin-
guish them. Resemblance and difference, then, are part of what is simultaneously present
- within perception as such - before we can speak at all of what it is we've perceived.
(Not to mention, the how and why of it.) We then must make our starting point the notion
of reciprocal presupposition (Hjelmslev's solidarity), as within the percept as such, the
one object-term can carry no significance without the other. This is not only the most
important assumption Greimas requires of us; it "is the only undefined logical concept
which allows us to define reciprocally, following Hjelmslev, signifier and signified."31
        But Greimas and Hjelmslev both want to transplant this notion to virtually every
stratum of description: the theory of signification, then, is but a "surface effect"; what
they're after would use this sole "undefined logical concept" in its arsenal as an all-pur-
pose tool. To reach the Semiotic Square from here, one "double articulates" what we've
just been given, and assumes that meaning is the result of the interlinking of two such
dyads, giving us the Square's four corners. But the verticals, which effect the soldering
between the initially unrelated dyadic "semes," do not, by dint of their opportunistic na-
ture, entail reciprocal presupposing, but only the one-way notion of "implication," with
the lower term somehow "containing" or being "generatively linked to" the one above it.

          Greimas also tells us that the diagonals, which indicate "contradiction" between a
seme and the absence of same, is linked to another of Jakobson's 3 primary categories of
binary opposition, called "privation": 2 phonemes, otherwise identical, differ in the pre-
sence of a mark: 'g' is voiced; 'k' is not. Is not the simplest way to indicate this by a
simple on/off bit - what "G toggling" gives? Giving a commonsensical yes to this ques-
tion quickly tells us our S should mark the vertical "implication" pathway. Here's why.
         First, mapping G to the 'privative' pathway means, once we've made our way
through the blizzard of names Greimas and his interpreters have used to highlight the
various attributes each pathway is assumed to display - as a relation between "paradig-
matic" place-holders or "states" on the semantic plane; as "syntagmatic" segments in a
performance of state-to-state syntax, itself dependent upon an "actantial" analysis which
further discriminates "actants" from "roles"; etc. - that we see it simply as the pure form
of the foundational Box-Kite binary, mutual exclusivity, implicit in saying 2 terms contra-
dict each other: if Castor is present, Pollux is not. But G alone, for reasons already cov-
ered, offers the possibility of linking this XOR notion to a no-exceptions, "+" or "-".32
         Next, reciprocal presupposition is the basis of linking the two semes into one se-
mantic bundling, and this operation is inherently (and explicitly described this way by
Greimas as) hierarchical: conjunction on one level, disjunction on the other. Horizontal
pathways are thus the only places that can say "X" marks the spot: for we then have the
ZD diagonals themselves on one level, and the units spanning their plane (and defining
their equations as just k(iU + iL)) on the other. By elimination, "S" must be the vertical.
         But one can argue positively, as well: given a seme, the first thing we frame is a
notion of its absence (hence, the "contradiction" pathway: mice only play in the lower
right slot if the seme "cat" is absent in the upper left; if a "light" seme is switched off,
barracks-bound recruits start sleeping - or maybe vampires leave their coffins). So, be-
fore we can consider the possibility of fusing two semes into a Square (which "mergers
and acquisitions" work is what the "implication" process underwrites), we already have
"G" in hand - and, for any given CDP level (which is what "G," as a power of 2, suffices
to indicate) the necessary precondition for such union is "S." For Sedenions, all "S"
values generate successful candidates for ZD status when our simple production rule is
used; for Pathions and higher 2N-ions, however, carry-bit overflow puts this status in
question, if S exceeds 8 and is not equal to some higher power of 2. For Pathions, this
means all S > 8 yield ensembles of 3 Box-Kites instead of 7, with the 7 distinct patterns
having a clear "flip-book" sequencing determined strictly by simple unit in- or de- cre-
ments to S. For the 64-D Chingons, 3 distinct ranges display different-sized ensembles.
As N increases further, we essentially are faced with a "spectroscopy" problem.

          To make this seem concrete, and see how it relates to attaining the NT "fractal
limit," a review of "emanation tables" (on which, see BK2) is in order. These do for
ZD's what Cayley Tables do for group operations. For a particular stratum of 2N-ions, K
= (2N-1 - 2) Assessors interact in Box-Kite ensembles for a given Strut Constant value: 6,
14, 30, 62 for N = 4, 5, 6, 7, and so on. For any S value, regardless of carry-bit overflow,
we can make a K x K product table, place Assessor labels on each row and column head,
and enter the results in the appropriate cells. Define headings in left-right, top-down or-
der, entering lowest L-index first, and put that of its strut-opposite in the mirror-opposite
slot; put the next-lowest not yet entered to the right of the first (and its strut-opposite just
left of the first such); continue in this manner until all L-indices are accounted for.
         If Assessors indicated by headings for a cell mutually zero-divide, put their ema-
nation (instead of "0") in the cell; otherwise, leave it empty. For all such tables, both
long diagonals will form an empty "X", since strut-opposites and an Assessor's own dia-
gonals never mutually zero-divide. For S values not subject to overflow, all other K2 -
2K cells ( = 24, 168, 840 for N = 4, 5, 6) will be filled. As this number is always a multi-
ple of 24 (the number of cell entries defining a Box-Kite), this means Strut Constants,
beyond the Sedenions, underwrite ensembles of interconnected Box-Kites: 7, 35, 155,
and 651 for N = 5, 6, 7, 8 (also the number of associative triplets for N = 3, 4, 5, 6).
         For S values where carry-bits matter, things get more complicated. As explained
in BK2, the 7 Pathion emanation tables for 8 < S < 16 are more sparse than expected:
only 72 cells (= 3 Box-Kites) are filled. With Chingons, 3 broad classes emerge in 64-D,
the first of which - due to its obvious "fractality" - we'll examine in detail later on.
         8 < S < 16 gives 19 instead of the "full set" of 35. Within this range, take the
Sedenion "sand mandala" with the same S, chop it into quadrants, and attach copies of
each to the starter image's corners. For S=15, fill the 8 same-sized regions on the peri-
meter with mirrorings of the starter-image quadrants, but with the empty diagonal stret-
ches replaced by 16's (or, if the diagonal below contains 8's not 7's, by "strut-opposite"
31's), and all other indices augmented by 16. Analogous "period-doubling" strategies
obtain in higher reaches, indicating an emanation-table-based route to the fractal limit as
N increases. (See drawings on left, below, for S=15 in Pathions, then Chingons.34) For
16 < S < 24, we've 7 Box-Kites, whose 14 x 14 central square mimes the Pathion emana-
tion table for S - 8, sans the crossing pairs of near-solid parallels - making the central
square for S=24 empty. 24 < S < 32 gives 23 Box-Kites (for S=25, see below right - and
note how "white space," unlike for S=15, is filled with, not empty of, entries!).

 Appendix: Box-Kite "Do-It-Yourself Kit"

        The basic "Box-Kite Machine" is an interactive form with 2 slots and 2 buttons:
enter the power of 2 which generates the 2N-ions of interest, then enter the Strut Constant
(any value from 1 to 2N - 1) of the Box-Kite ensemble you wish to explore. Click the
"Produce Tone Row" button, and the lower parts of the form fill in in a split second: low
and high indices of all the Assessor pairs, in emanation-table row and column, with the
full spelling out of these dyads in the "Tone Row Pairs" listing at the end. After you've
spent about two seconds getting that much produced (with maybe 200 lines of code doing
the work "under the hood"), you click one more button to "Create Emanation Table"
according to the specifications. Except for N pushing two digits or worse, the CSV text-
file dumped out by this operation takes a split second, and then you just roll over into an
Excel spreadsheet, import said textfile into a worksheet, and then play with colorizing.
        Ignoring user-interface overhead ("exiting event" code in field slots and other
stuff that's part of the "implementation cost" but otherwise irrelevant), the whole machine
runs on only 3 little programs (ca. 100 lines each, written in the Visual Basic customized
for the Notes object-hierarchy called "LotusScript" that the business analyst's workstation
I was building for a major investment house required I immerse myself in). I've attached
the highly inelegant code for these below. (Inelegant, because written superfast, under
duress of having things I was supposed to be doing that paid the bills; also, because the
library calls were subject to some parameter-passing bugginess that I had to do grotesque
workarounds to bypass, leading to very stupid-looking code. The point, though, was to
get this machine built in a hurry, and not worry about "elegance"!)
        This could easily be ported to Java or a Mathematica notebook, where much more
sophisticated things become possible (e.g., New Kinds of Databases and simulation work
based on them). The 3 modules do the following:

        1) Crunch Cayley-Dickson Process into a stupidly self-evident method for gener-
ating signed products of arbitrary imaginaries of any subscript (see the discussion of the 3
rules that run everything in my prior "BK4" paper on the Wolfram Science site: "Triple
Negatives Rule" and "Trident Product" and "Recursive Bottoming" and that's it).

       2) Given N and S, create the appropriate lower-index terms to serve as row and
column labels in the "emanation table," and then put them in proper order (being sure, of
course, to eliminate the "strut-constant" S itself from said listing!).

        3) A double-for-loop which runs through the row-and-column listing of indices
twice, calculating the cell values in the table. There's 2 arrays for low- and high- index
units in the Assessors each such label signifies, and then the full Assessor of each row
label is multiplied times each column's full Assessor, and if they DO zero-divide, the
third Assessor in their Sail has its lower-index term entered in the appropriate cell. (If the
two Assessors do NOT mutually zero-divide, the cell is left blank).

        That's it! And if Part II's proof of the all-important Sky meta-fractal's existence
and nature seems too skimpy, just look at the code-produced results I'll showcase there.
Pascal's notion of "mathematical induction" will make "proof" a given.

         The first function performs signed multiplications of two hypercomplex units,
given their subscripts (i.e., the "XOR of indices = index of product" rule is assumed).
Here's the code, which can be thought of as "Cayley-Dickson for Dummies":

"click event" of the button you can see in the screenshot, "Generate Tone Row." The
name is inspired by Schonberg's tone-row, and the choice of strut-constant-based row of
Assessor labels does service as the "musical scale" from which all else is "composed."

        The title of a highly influential precursor of "small-world" theory, Mark S. Granovetter's paper in The
    American Journal of Sociology, 78 (1973), 1360-1380, whose original context was, in fact, the way
    people find jobs: not, as one might at first assume, through their closest friends (since the overlap
    between their and one's own connections will be too great to provide too many "leads"); but rather,
    through remote acquaintances (who have their own small groups of close friends, with which one is
    likely to have almost no intersection except through such "weak ties"). "Small-world" theory as such,
    meanwhile, derives from a paper whose influence has proven inversely proportional to its length: Dun-
    can J. Watts and Steven H. Strogatz, "Collective dynamics of 'small-world' networks," Nature, 393
    (1998), 440-442. For a fuller presentation, see Duncan J. Watts, Small Worlds: The Dynamics of
    Networks Between Order and Randomness (Princeton NJ: Princeton University Press, 1999); for the
    intimate relationship between small-world and scale-free network theory, see Albert-L<U+00E1>szl<U+00F3> Barab<U+00E1>si,
    Linked: How Everything Is Connected to Everything Else And What It Means for Business, Science,
    and Everyday Life (New York: Penguin Books, 2003). "Six degrees of Kevin Bacon"- a take on the
    title of John Guare's 1990 similarly-themed play, Six Degrees of Separation - derives from three inebri-
    ated fraternity brothers who managed to ride their goofy idea into TV and Internet exposure: see Ann
    Oldenburg, "A thousand links to Kevin Bacon: Game calculates actor's connection," USA Today (Oc-
    tober 18, 1996), p. 51. One of the clearest instances of a "small-world network," ironically, is provided
    by the Kevin-Bacon-like "Erd<U+00F6>s number" of mathematical collaboration: those who've written papers
    with the prolific Hungarian have Erd<U+00F6>s number = 1; those who haven't collaborated with Erd<U+00F6>s himself,
    but have co-authored papers with people who have, have Erd<U+00F6>s number = 2; no mathematician who's
    ever collaborated on a paper has been found with Erd<U+00F6>s number higher than 17, and most - over
    100,000 - have Erd<U+00F6>s number 5 or 6: see Jerry Grossman's " Erd<U+00F6>s Number Project Home Page,"
    www.oakland.edu/~grossman/erdoshp.html. This is ironic, because Erd<U+00F6>s collaborated on a famous
    series of papers that created the theory of random networks - a beautiful theory which "small-world"
    thinking had to chuck out the window before it could find itself eliciting laws for real networks. Those
    with an obsession should also visit Brett Tjaden's "Oracle of Bacon" web page, which contains a list of
    the 1000 best-connected actors and their distribution sequences (many of the most connected of whom,
    surprise, are porn stars): www.cs.virginia.edu/bct7m/bacon.html.

    Doreen Weightman, transl. (New York: Harper & Row, 1981; French original, 1971), pp. 644-5: "It
    would seem that the point at which music and mythology began to appear as reversed images of each
    other coincided with the invention of the fugue, that is, a form of composition which, as I have shown on
    several occasions, exists in a fully developed form in the myths, from which music might at any time
    have borrowed it. If we ask what was peculiar about the period when music discovered the fugue, the
    answer is that it corresponded to the beginning of the modern age, when the forms of mythic thought
    were losing ground in the face of the new scientific knowledge, and were giving way to fresh modes of
    literary expression. With the invention of the fugue and other subsequent forms of composition, music
    took over the structures of mythic thought at a time when the literary narrative, in changing from myth to
    the novel, was ridding itself of these structures. It was necessary, then, for myth as such to die for its
    form to escape from it, like the soul leaving the body, and to seek a means of reincarnation in
    music." [Bold italics provided by this author, not the anthropologist.]

    accessible postmodernist text that can provide a good introduction to the general issues and vocabulary
    we'll be working with, Ronald Schleifer's A. J. Greimas and the Nature of Meaning: Linguistics, Semio-
    tics and Discourse Theory (Lincoln NB: University of Nebraska Press, 1987). On p. 17, he explains
      that "'Double articulation,' a term developed by Andr<U+00E9> Martinet, is the presence - the reciprocal presup-
     position - of both combination and contrast. In this conception, language presents two distinct planes of
     analysis. Each of the 'units of the first articulation,' Martinet argues, 'presents a meaning and a vocal (or
     phonic) form. It cannot be analyzed into smaller successive units endowed with meaning . . . But the
     vocal form itself is analysable into a series of units each of which makes its contribution to distin-
     guishing t<U+00EA>te from other units such as b<U+00EA>te, tante, or terre.' In traditional linguistics, the first articulation
     is the combinatory of grammar (or morphology) while the second is that of phonology." As with CDP,
     redoubling can be extended indefinitely - and, in fact ("Hjelmslev's Net"), must be.

     without the other: a double deterritorialization..." (P. 392) And, in percipient conformity with the
     current theme, they develop a philosophy of Number they call "nomadic" (cutely opposed to Leibniz's
     "monadic") which is primordially topological: "It is the number itself that moves through smooth
     space.... The more independent space is from a metrics, the more independent the number is from
     space." (P. 389). Or again, "Smooth space is a field without conduits or channels. A field, a
     heterogeneous smooth space, is wedded to a very particular type of multiplicity: nonmetric, acentered
     [i.e., not coordinated by Identity operators], rhizomatic multiplicities [tracing connections between
     inherent and palpable Singularities, rather than branchings from a unified Tree] that occupy space
     without 'counting' it and can 'be explored only by legwork.' [e.g., as embedded in a network]." (P. 371)

         Of most moment, for our interests, is Deleuze's short essay, "A quoi reconnait-on le structuralisme?,"
     in F. Chatelet, ed., Histoire de la philosophie (Paris: Hachette, 1973), which Petitot discusses at length
     in Section 3.3, "Deleuze's proposal for a schematism of structure," of his Morphogenesis of Meaning,
     transl. Franson Manjali (New York: Peter Lang, 2004; French original, 1985), henceforth MM. The
     notion of "place-holder" is argued to be fundamental to all structuralism, and the "empty place" the
     basis of any notion of "symbolic." As Petitot notes, referring to this piece, "The identity of a symbolic
     place is not what ensures its stability, but what ensures the possibility of its displacement.... If the rela-
     tive displacement (metonymy) can be an intrinsic part of the identity of position, it is because every
     structure 'contains an object or an element which is quite paradoxical.' This paradoxical element is of a
     kind very different from the symbolic elements, the differential relations, and the singularities. It circu-
     lates within the series as if it was 'its own metaphor and its own metonymy' (p. 322). It lacks any onto-
     logical function (it is not an object), any self-likeness (it is not an image), and logical identity (it is not a
     concept) (p. 323). And if the relative displacements is [sic] an intrinsic part of positional identities, it is
     because the relative place of the terms in the structure depends on their absolute place in relation to this
     element." (Petitot's p. 61). But what can this 'quite paradoxical ' element be but Zero in a place-based
     scheme of digitization, with structuralism thereby being an exercise, ultimately, in ZD representings?

     Structural Stability and Morphogenesis (Reading MA: W. A. Benjamin, 1975; French original, 1972),
     henceforth SSM: of the 27 illustrations in the 1975 translation's "centerfold," 6 are of such geological
     "catastrophes" as fault-lines, beach domes, river beds, and superposed laminar strata in rock; many more
     such images populate the main body of the text (viz., the drawings accompanying the 3rd endnote to
     Chapter 7, showing "threshold stabilization" at work in the erosion of a jurassic anticline).

        A wealth of homey "toy models" of this variety can be found in E. C. Zeeman's now-classic Scientific
     American article of April, 1978 - especially the 60-page draft version included in his Catastrophe
     Theory: Selected Papers, 1972-1977 (Reading MA: Addison-Wesley, 1977), pp. 1-64, as well as the
     "Social Sciences" and "Discussion" chapters (302-407, and 604-658, respectively).

        For what it's worth, this is a literal fact: octahedral lattices are known to be rigid; an octahedral box-
     kite with pairs of dowels joining along each strut axis in the center, effectively produces an 18-edged
     figure with 7 vertices. Per A. L. Loeb's degrees-of-freedom formula, rigidity requires E <U+2265> 3V - 6, which
     means we get just the right count even if we somehow assume 3 dowels can magically (i.e., in purely
     "mathematical space") pass through the central 7th vertex without requiring their splitting into pairs of
     real-world sections. See the discussion on rigidity in Jay Kappraff, Connections: The Geometric Bridge
     Between Art and Science (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1991), pp. 270-3.

       The term is not chosen arbitrarily: anyone who's used an oscilloscope knows that the appearance of
     diagonals indicates the two orthogonal variables represented onscreen are "in sync"; it is also known
      that synchronization plays a highly organizing role in Chaotic systems. On all this, see Steven Strogatz,
     Sync: The Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order (Hyperion Books, 2003), especially Chapter 7:
     "Synchronized Chaos."

       This point is developed further in my third "Box-Kite" monograph (henceforth, "BK3"), "Quizzical
     Quaternions, Mock Octonions, and Other Zero-Divisor-Suppressing 'Sleeper Cell' Structures in the
     Sedenions and 2N-ions," available at http://arXiv.org/abs/math.RA/0403113. For background on the
     basics of Box-Kites, index labeling schemes, and CDP, see http://arXiv.org/abs/math.GM/0011260
     ("BK1"), "The 42 Assessors and the Box-Kites they fly: Diagonal Axis-Pair Systems of Zero-Divisors
     in the Sedenions' 16 Dimensions." The logic and graphics of "carry-bit overflow" in higher 2N-ions'
     "emanation tables" - specifically, the "sand mandalas" in the 32-D Pathions, which provide the basis for
     extrapolations to scale-free networks - are treated in "BK2": "Flying Higher Than a Box-Kite: Kite-
     Chain Middens, Sand Mandalas, and Zero-Divisor Patterns in 2N-ions Beyond the Sedenions,"

     to NKS concerns, can be found in "BK4": my NKS 2004 presentation, "The 'Something From Nothing'

       Gell-Mann's "Eightfold Way," based on SU(3) symmetry - equivalently, A2 in "Dynkinese," which
     yields up the simplest Fold Catastrophe with germ X3 and one control working on the X monomial -
     gets its count by taking the hexagon of roots (hence, the correspondence to the most primitive kid's
     kaleidoscope, made by 2 mirrors placed at a 60o angle, in "Coxeter" dialect) and adding 2. If the 2-D
     backdrop is assumed, closest packing of spheres within it (the link to coding theory) is just the root-
     count, 6: for A3, the 3-D closest-packing number of 12 is the root-count as well (or the image-count in a
     3-mirror kaleidoscope, mirrors 1 and 2, 2 and 3 meeting in dihedral angles of 60o to make a wedge). For
     4 and 5 dimensions, though, the closest packings correspond to the D-series root-counts associated with
     so-called "Feynman checkerboard" patterns, of 24 and 40 respectively (28 and 45, if "Cartan subalge-
     bras" are included). For 6-, 7-, and 8- D, the E-series serves similarly, with respective root-counts of 72,
     128, and 240 (78, 133, and 248 with subscripts ladled in). Superstring theory's first great "aha!"
     occurred when the "anomaly count" for 16-D heterotic strings was shown to be 496: just the tally
     generated by two orthogonal spaces, each associated with the Octonions' (non-associative) algebra - or
     "E8 x E8" for short! Meanwhile, on the theme of "84" which triggered this note: it is perhaps ironic that
     this number is associated with the study of "Hurwitz Groups," which play a crucial role in the study of
     compact Riemann surfaces of genus at least 2 (whose automorphism groups have maximum order of 84
     (g-1)). It's well-known that a Hurwitz group of smallest order is a simple group, and as there's no
     Hurwitz group of order 84, then the discrete group of PSL(2,R) over the unique field with seven
     elements formed by the integers {0,1,2,3,4,5,6} under addition and multiplication modulo 7, has order
     twice 84 = 168, hence is "simple." This gives us the smallest finite projective space, the "Fano Plane" -
     which we navigate with the PSL(2,7) triangle! Given that all the "A, D, E" apparatus and form language
     can justly be said to be the extension of the symmetric wealth of implications stuffed inside the
     icosahedral E8, which in turn - as Galois showed - has a 60-element rotation group which is the first
     non-trivial group to be "simple," with the first Hurwitz group being the second, and Conway's
     "Monster" being the last, it is easy to believe two things: first, that the wealth of implications stuffed
     inside CDP ZD's, which are clearly as intimately connected to the Hurwitz group as "A, D, E" pheno-
     mena are to Galois' alternating group, is not just unexplored but huge; second, that both the Galois and
     Hurwitz "simple" groups are minuscule compared to Conway's, with so many others straddling the
     enormous gap between them, suggesting that all our mathematical understanding at present is likely
     next to nothing from the "God's eye" view! A good intro to Hurwitz groups, in a context which expli-
     citly includes the general setting wherein Timaeus and hyperbolic (hence Dolgachev's, per the coming
     Note 20) triangles emerge, is Chapter 6 of Gareth A. Jones and David Singerman, Complex Functions:
     An algebraic and geometric viewpoint (Cambridge UK: Cambridge University Press, 1987), coming to
     a head for us on p. 261. (P.S.: the Pathions have 77 Box-Kites; add the Sedenion 7, and get 84 again!)

       Algirdas Greimas, Structural Semantics: An Attempt at a Method, Daniele McDowell, Ronald Schlei-
     fer, Alan Velie, transl. (Lincoln NB and London: University of Nebraska Press, 1983; French original,
     1966), p. 129. If Greimas's "two marks" be a pair of mutual ZD's, instead of oppositely signed in-
     stances of "X" (which we take to designate opposite termini of some Box-Kite edge); and if, finally, his
     "+" be replaced by a multiplicative sign, the correspondence between his setup and ours would be nigh
     complete. His choices of mathematical symbols being purely conventional (and hence, for the purposes
     of his argument, merely arbitrary), those suggested are just as viable as Greimas's own - and offer up
      the bonus of framing a substantive theory, as we will soon see. Note, too, we get the inherent split of his
     "marks" into dyads (the unit pairs comprising Assessors) "for free" this way - which gives us two
     mutually reinforcing readings of his "re-marks" simultaneously.
17
       John Allen Paulos, Mathematics and Humor (Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press,
     1980) makes this point in great detail. Its analysis, unfortunately, doesn't take things much further than
     the Cusp's immediate "big brother," the 3-control Swallow's Tail.

        This returns us to the theme of Note 15: the Hurwitz simple group - which, after all, is seminal for us,
     and hence our paradigmatic instance of the Fuchsian groups which were the subject of Poincar<U+00E9>'s
     "Aha!" experience. Returning to Jones and Singerman's text cited in that note, we read on p. 221 that
     "The connection between the group PSL(2,R) and hyperbolic geometry was discovered by Henri Poin-
     car<U+00E9> (1854-1912) and published in 1882. (Poincar<U+00E9> used this discovery to illustrate the sometimes
     spontaneous nature of mathematical creativity. He relates how, when boarding a bus, the idea suddenly
     came to him that the transformations he had used to define Fuchsian functions were identical with those
     of non-Euclidean geometry.)"

     Prilozh 6:4 (1972), 3-25. In a later paper translated in Russ. Math. Surv. 33:5 (1978), 99-116, Arnol'd
     extended the "A, D, E Correspondence" to "B, C, F" (on manifolds with boundary); later workers in his
     school have stirred up so many correspondences (to every item, in fact, in Coxeter's very long list) that
     it might be better to dub the ensemble "Alphabet Soup." The first cross-disciplinary study of this
     "mysterious unity of all things," as it was described by the very unmystical Arnol'd, is M. Hazewinkel,
     W. Hesselink, D. Siersma, F. D. Veldkamp, "The ubiquity of Coxeter-Dynkin diagrams (an introduction
     to the A-D-E Problem)," Nieuw Arch. Wisk. 25 (1977), 257-307. More recently, John Baez has
     devoted many installments of his weekly website offerings to this theme; see, too, the discussions and
     numerous links on Tony Smith's website.

        See the discussion in V. I Arnol'd, S. M. Gusein-Zade and A. N. Varchenko, Singularities of Differen-
     tiable Maps, Vol. I: The Classification of Critical Points, Caustics and Wave Fronts (Boston: Birkh<U+00E4>u-
     ser, 1985), pp. 183-6, 242-6. These 3 triangles are the bases of the 3 infinite families of "unimodular"
     germs, typically written with 3 subscripts to the letter "T" (one for each power its X, Y, or Z "behavior"
     displays in the germ), these subscripts being just the fraction of a straight angle included in successive
     angles of the triangle. Hence, the Equilateral, Right Isosceles, and 30-60-90 of Plato's cosmogony are
     rendered in the following manner: T3,3,3; T2,4,4; T2,3,6 (also expressed, just to make things confusing, as P8,
     X9, and J10 in the literature, with X9 being Jim Callahan's preferred way of indicating the famous
     "Double Cusp" Catastrophe). The "maximal strata" of these 3 are the finite E series of "simple" germs
     - and these, in turn, can be interpreted as the symmetries of the Platonic Solids: E6, then, represents the
     tetrahedron; E7, the symmetrically dual cube and octahedron ; and E8, the dodeca- and icosa- hedral
     duals. These designations arise from a special "A-D-E" relationship known as the "McKay Correspon-
     dence," which is described in the just-cited reference (on p. 184) as follows: "These singularities may
     also be obtained from the regular polyhedra in three-dimensional Euclidean space or more precisely
     from the discrete subgroups of the group SU(2): they describe relations between the basic invariants of
     the groups. Ak corresponds to the polygons, Dk to the dihedra (the two-sided polygons)" - and the E
     series, to the Solids as just indicated. Arnol'd's associate Dolgachev has meanwhile (see p. 185) ex-
     tended these amazingly simplistic yet deep correspondences into higher reaches: the 14 "exceptional"
     forms among the unimodular germs (i.e., comprising finite listings, like the E series among the "elemen-
     tary" germs), "may be obtained from the 14 triangles in the Lobechevskii plane [and hence realizable by
     M. C. Escher-style "hyperbolic tessellations"] or more precisely from the discrete subgroups of the
     group SU(1,1) determined by them" - with the triangles' angles, again, bearing exact correspondences
     to germinal exponents (in terms of what are now called the "Dolgachev numbers" linked to them).

        James Callahan, "Bifurcation Geometry of E6," Mathematical Modeling, 1 (1980), 283-309 lays out
     the "Dynkinese" implicit in E6 and how it decomposes into 3 classes of maximal strata: Petitot's Dual
      and Standard Butterfly forms, and the Umbilics which will concern us when we consider Trip-Sync-
     based "message-passing," in relation to the Semiotic Square as postmodernists see it. In sequal studies
     (the last two of which were co-authored with psychoanalyst Jerome Sashin), he developed the "tableau"
     approach as a method for modeling emotional affect response: see "A Geometric Model of Anorexia
     and Its Treatment," Behavioral Science, 27 (1982), 140-154; "Models of Affect-Response and Anorexia

     Cawagas' "Finitas" software, which he makes freely available, lets one calculate loops and other
     nonassociative structures rather easily in higher-dimensional contexts; he in fact found an equivalent
     manner of expressing my tabulations from BK1 in "loop language," which he presented in a 2004 paper
     to the National Research Council of the Philippines, "On the Structure and Zero Divisors of the
     Sedenion Algebra"; the correspondence which ensued after he communicated this to me proved
     delightfully engaging, and was the direct trigger for "BK3." On reading this, he further suggested I was
     engaging in "representation theory" - an intimation which surprised me at first, but then became an
     obsession ... upon which much of this monograph can be blamed!
26
       Dually, we could assume the reverse, adopting an "odometer-wheel reading" convention, in which
     case, per the earlier discussion of U- and L- index flows around a Box-Kite's hexagon, counterclockwise
     and clockwise change places in what follows ... and the flow-reversal happens along the Tray-Rack
     edge opposite that specified. (But either way, obstacle-bypassing still involves detouring to the Zigzag
     Assessor perpendicular to the Tray-Rack in question.)
27
       Arnol'd has talked about this "boundary singularity" in many places, but the best starting point is his
     book largely inspired by its amazing history as well as its surprising wealth of applications, Huygens and
     Barrow, Newton and Hooke , Eric J. F. Primrose, transl. (Basel, Boston, Berlin: Birkh<U+00E4>user Verlag,
     1990; Russian original, 1989). See especially Chapter 3: "From Evolvents to Quasicrystals," pp. 53-66,
     where largely overlooked mathematics of two centuries' past are dusted off, put in their own and current
     contexts, and found to be an endless fount of surprises and new insights. Bennequin's lecture to the
     1984/5 Bourbaki seminar, "Caustiques mystiques," first revealed, as Arnol'd tells us in his introduction,
     "that the first textbook on analysis, written by l'H<U+00F4>pital from the lectures of Johann Bernoulli, contains a
     representation of the manifold of irregular orbits of the Coxeter group H3 (generated by reflexions in the
     planes of symmetry of an icosahedron). This representation appears there not in connection with the
     group of symmetries of the icosahedron, but as a result of investigations of evolvents of plane curves
     with a point of inflexion, investigations very close to those of Huygens (and possibly even carried out by
     him, although the first publication was apparently due to l'H<U+00F4>pital). Illustrations appearing in recent
     works on the connection between the icosahedron and singularities of evolutes and evolvents and, it
     should be said, obtained by modern mathematicians not without difficulty and even with the help of
     computers, were already known at that time." What will intrigue us later is this: the icosahedral "group
     of symmetries" is based on the 15 median-flips plus identity, hence resides in 16-D, with the singularity
     appearing on its 4-D boundary. But the Sedenions likewise live in 16-D, and - as Moreno points out -
     have a 4-D "boundary" of ZD-free lebensraum to complement the 12-D Box-Kites need. More,
     consider the "words" and their readings that Quincunx lanyards can generate. As Sails can be either
     Zigzags or Trefoils, here we have Feet or Hands: If the "detour" is to the Zigzag Assessor, we get 10
     possible starting points to read or write "/////\\\\\"; if we avoid the traffic-flow obstacle by the Vent
     Assessor instead, we get 10 strings from this: "/\\//\//\\." Since scalar value along a diagonal doesn't
     matter, we are free to treat signing as binary "flow-orientation." And each Tray-Rack has its own
     Quincunx string-set. So 2 types x 3 Tray-Racks x 10 string-readings each x 2 flow-reversals = 120.
     Note further than Feet and Hands each break into two mirror-opposite 5-diagonal substrings, and that
     the 16-D singularity has (among other "preparations") a dynamic defined by a "double Swallow's Tail"
     (a Z5 germ, with 3 controls on the 3 low monomials, Z running down the left or right slope of Pascal's
     Triangle, depending upon whether it be set to X or Y), with the 4-D "content" - the boundary singularity
     - unfolding the symmetric terms 1, xy, x2y2, x3y3 in a so-called "open" Swallow's Tail. Finally, consider
     the workings of RNAi, which seems to be the master mechanism for turning genes off: it hunts for
     chunks of DNA made of mirror-image string-pairs; the Swallowtail, meanwhile, models self-destructive
     processes (Thom's "suicide catastrophe"). In Thom's 1971 model, which will come up more than once
     here, the 5-fold-symmetric "pentagram" unfolding effectively ends the "transmission" between Double
      Cusps if we adapt it to the heuristic in BK1, which is sketchily alluded to in Section 14. All of which
     commentary must suffer in the limbo of these notes until some later date, when something more formally
     elegant (or simulation-based in its substantiveness) can be said about it.
28
        Jean Petitot-Cocorda, Physique du Sens: De la th<U+00E9>orie des singularit<U+00E9>s aux structures s<U+00E9>mio-narratives
     (Paris: CNRS Editions, 1992), henceforth PS, pp. 388-394, discusses this in some detail, with generous
     graphical accompaniments, in the follow-up discussions of open problems upon completion of his "Se-
     miotic Square" arguments. In particular, he reverts to a second "Greimas Glitch," framed in a 1973
     paper called "Un probl<U+00E8>me de s<U+00E9>miotique narrative: les object de valeur." Here, Greimas focused on
     the conundrum posed by the seemingly simple (indeed, ubiquitous) phenomenon of "double transfer,"
     which I must somehow magically negotiate, in spite of its epistemological difficulty, each time I un-
     pocket two quarters to procure the morning paper. This problem is so mysteriously intractible that
     "even if one makes use of the Cuspoid X8 [the Star], it is not possible to schematize the double transfer
     in a simple manner." As we'll see later, the way the Star relates to our "twist product" is via a dynamic
     interaction between two (or even three ) Double Cusps - something we "get for free" by "twisting,"
     since the pairs of ZD's before and after it reside, as said above in the main text, in different Box-Kites.
29
        Greimas's own "actantial" analysis clearly requires this double-articulated approach to his SS: on the
     one hand, Thom's CT models explicitly derive from the "actantial" approach of Tesni<U+00E8>re's El<U+00E9>ments de
     syntaxe structurale (Paris: Klincksieck, 1959), also a key source of Greimas's own thoughts, as Petitot
     has discussed at some length. The Double Cusp's "generic sentence" with four minima has been an oft-
     discussed feature of any language models of the case-based variety since such models originated: see
     Zeeman, op. cit., where we are told in 1974 that the "most interesting key to linguistics, therefore, seems
     to lie in the study of paths in the double cusp, and the associated sequences of entrances, exits and
     transfer between the 4 actors involved, and the comparison of these paths with Thom's original
     classification of basic sentences." (p. 632) These remarks should be compared with Greimas's own,
     from his 1976 study of Maupassant, cited in Schleifer, op. cit., p. 156: "analytical experience - both our
     own and that of other semioticians - has convincingly demonstrated that, to account for texts even a
     little complex, it is necessary to consider the possibility of exploding (<U+00E9>clatement) any actant into at
     least four actantial positions" on the Semiotic Square.

     isomorphism with (among other structures) the Klein Group (p. 88), and L<U+00E9>vi-Strauss's "canonical law
     of myths" (p. 89). My ZD labeling scheme serves to answer a deep question Petitot asks after showing
     the inadequacy of Boolean logic to handle the task: "How to conceive of relations of junction (conjunc-
     tion/disjunction) and of reciprocal presupposition which are 'pure', that is to say independent of the spe-
     cific semes whose value they determine?" (MM, p. 30)

     Collins, transl. (Minneapolis and London: U. of Minnesota Press, 1993; French original, 1991). As the
     foreword to the English translation of this last book-length work by Greimas puts it, "The very fact that
     one of the first definitions in Descartes's theory deals with the relation between active nad passive expla-
     nations of passions had as a consequence the linking of passions not only to reason but also to actions.
     Within this framework Greimas's strategy was to work out a semiotic of passions, a pathemic semiotics
     founded on his own previously elaborated semiotics of action." (P. ix) The work concludes with a study
     of "the general syntax of jealousy," wherein Racine's Roxane "gives us an almost complete and parti-
     cularly detailed realization of the microsequence" of abstract patterns of emotional investment and
     hedging that constitute the "fiduciary" dynamics of jealous entanglement as the Semiotic Square would
     model it (with the key characters at 3 of the Square's 4 corners, as well as giving us "a fourth position,"
     encountered in the form of the 'gift of trust' that seems to correspond to an attachment formed by
     'abandoning distrust.' (P.182, where the diagram appears)

        The Chingon graphic for S=15 bears an obvious relationship to the combined effect of two Cesaro
     "triangle sweeps" initiated by [0,1] and [1,0], depicted on pp. 64-5 of Benoit Mandelbrot, The Fractal
     Geometry of Nature (San Francisco: W. H. Freeman, 1983; first edition, 1972). As we'll argue more
     formally later, the key is in the "spectrographic" effect of all bits to the left of that in the '4's' position:
     each row and column in the S=15 emanation table will have all entries for 8, 16, 24 filled (save for those
     which fall on the long diagonals); redoubling for the same S and keeping the screen size constant would
     thereby induce a doubling of the number of such lines (as well as new subdiagonals in quadrants, etc.).

The "Something From Nothing" Insertion Point: Where NKS Research
 into Physics Foundations Can Expect the "Most Bang for the Buck"
                      Robert de Marrais rdemarrais@alum.mit.edu

1: Introducing the "Box-Kite Papers" and Zero-Divisors Generally
         The focus of this presentation is the largely unexplored subject of "zero-divisors,"
(henceforth, "ZD's") which are forms of (hypercomplex) imaginary numbers with the
peculiar property that two such, if chosen properly, are both substantial quantities - yet
they have, as their product, nothing. Like the gnarly "coastline curves" classical analysis
dismissed as "monstrosities" until Mandelbrot tamed them, then generalized "fractals"
from the examples they offered, such algebraic beasts have been deemed "pathological"
ever since a celebrated proof of Hurwitz's showed, a little over a century ago, that such
entities are not just oddballs, but unavoidable.1 (And, a little less than seven years ago,
the Mexican mathematician Guillermo Moreno2 showed more: in the 16-D imaginaries
called "Sedenions" where we're first forced to deal with them, ZD's conform to some
remarkably familiar algebraic patterns which have echoes in all higher, 2N-dimensional,
extensions of imaginaries. This led immediately to my own research, and a series of three
monographs and counting which I call, for visually intuitive reasons I'll get to in short
order, the "box-kite papers," shorthanded herein as BK1, BK2, and BK3 respectively.3)
         What Hurwitz showed in 1896 marked the end, in one key sense, of the revolution
begun in the 1810's by taking those entities Descartes had derisively deemed "imaginary"
seriously. The stupendously deep rethinking of all mathematics they facilitated in the
hands of Gauss, Galois, Fourier, Reimann, et al., led some people to suspect a general
strategy: after many years' frustration, William Rowan Hamilton was able to generalize
the 2-D algebraic geometry of the complex plane to the 4-D context which the science of
mechanics, as he envisioned it, required: in a fit of inspiration, he carved the famous
formula "i2 = j2 = k2 = ijk = -1" with a penknife on the bridge he was crossing. What
made finding this easy equation so difficult is this codicil: ij = -ji, and ditto for jk (and
-kj) and ki (and -ik), which is to say Quaternion multiplication is anti-commutative.
         Those familiar with the Feynman lectures will know, though, that this is precisely
what's required for a basis of vectors describing the way real forces work (which the great
Brooklyn physicist was wont to demonstrate by rotating books and other objects in two
different senses, in differing sequence, in class). If losing the commutative law of mul-
tiplication is the price you pay, then, for the calculus of dot and cross products (without
which Maxwell's equations, among other things, would hardly be thinkable), why com-
plain? And some contemporaries of Hamilton not only didn't grumble, but they sought to
push the envelope even further, which led Cayley and Dickson and Graves to double
dimension once again, yielding the 8-D Octonions, wherein even the associative law
breaks down. This means, among other things, that their symmetries can't even be codi-
fied with group theory, since simple expressions like "abc" become suddenly problema-
tic: for, generally speaking, a<U+00B7>(b<U+00B7>c) and (a<U+00B7>b)<U+00B7>c may well have opposite signs! (Hence,
algebraists concerned with such things speak of "loops" not groups, which do for
nonassociative operations what groups ought to do but can't!4)


R. de Marrais                              Page 1               "Something From Nothing"
         Algebraically, the number fields of Imaginaries, Quaternions, and Octonions (usu-
ally indicated by C for complex, H for Hamilton, and O) all conform to a "squares rule":
expressing, say, an arbitrary complex number as z = a + bi, and another as z' = c + di, we
take for granted that the absolute value of their product is equal to the product of their ab-
solute values (i.e., it "has a norm"); alternatively, writing things out in terms of compo-
nents, we get a relationship between squares (i.e., "the product of one sum of two squares
by another is a sum of two squares as well"): (ac - bd)2 + (ad + bc)2 = (a2 + b2)(c2 + d2)
        This generalizes to sums of 4 and 8 squares, for Quaternions and Octonions in that
order, and the formulas, while excruciatingly tedious to calculate in the pre-computer
days when Cayley and company were investigating all this, are conceptually, at least,
rather easy to grasp. People naturally wanted to keep doubling dimensions, to find even
weirder and niftier number fauna, but Hurwitz spoiled their fun by showing that one more
doubling to 16-D induces the loss of something even more critical than associativity: the
very notion of a norm (and hence possibility of a straightforward "squares rule"5) goes out
the window. That is, defining a metric (and hence, standard "field" structure) becomes
problematic; corollarily, you get zero-divisors (i.e., number-theoretic "black holes").
        That last parenthetical remark, though, suggests a context wherein Sedenions, and
even higher 2N-ions, might prove of real use: studying quantum gravity. Of the many
aspects of the latter that make it hard to integrate with standard QM, one in particular
makes the breakdown of norms spring to mind: the index of what we might call an
electron's "self-absorption," the "fine structure constant" of 1/137, has analogues for the
weak and strong forces, but for gravity the "constant" in fact is a variable! A survey by
three Estonian physicists of Nonassociative Algebras in Physics frames this in terms of
"infobarriers," or "certain limits in obtaining information" - related to the degree of
"hypercomplexity"required to study their limit-case phenomena (linked in turn to certain
limit-case constants, such as Einstein's c and Planck's h, for C and H respectively):

       Complex numbers seem to have a fundamental connection with the special
       theory of relativity allowing to introduce the light cone and a
       nondetermined interval for events. The noncommutativity of QM is
       related to the uncertainty relations and the complementarity principle, and
       is characteristically represented by the quaternion units satisfying the same
       commutation relations as do the angular momentum operators.6

         The authors also discuss Octonionic arguments advanced since the 1970's to
model a third infobarrier, associated with the strong force: quark confinement. And
clearly, Octonionic modeling has been running rampant since the advent of superstrings
and M-Theory, where a stress that sometimes verges on "negative theology" is placed
upon the implications of certain kinds of non-observability.7 But more germane here is a
brief "blue sky" piece by Andrei Sakharov8 concerning an underlying spacetime "lattice"
structure (the lattice constant being the Planck length) subtending gravity, linked to a
spontaneous, post-Big Bang, phase transition - with gravity as some kind of elasticity of
this lattice (and hence of its "metric"). Our Estonian authors see a role here in studying
this fourth infobarrier involving the Sedenions - at which point, their book ends, and my
own thoughts (with progressively emerging links to NKS modeling) begin . . .

R. de Marrais                              Page 2               "Something From Nothing"
          The Estonians play with various preparations of Sedenions which serve to mute or
suppress their distinctive zero-divisor features: "binary" and "ternary" Sedenion schemes
which can be almost tamed by matrix methods, etc. This is understandable, as they were
thinking about "infobarriers" at a time when ZD's still seemed "pathological." But the
history of the hypercomplex should suggest to us that even the loss of structure implicit in
ZD's portends some unsuspected gain in other aspects. Just what might this be? The
answer is quite surprising: contrary to a century's intuition in this area, what I find is a
tendency toward spontaneous cobbling together of ever more elaborate structure as the N
in 2N-ions gets bigger; more, that this "mustering" (and its reverse process, which I think
of - to continue the military analogy - as "demobilizing") is necessarily interlinked with
the survival of "classical" structures (specifically, associative triplets, clones of the Qua-
ternions' "i, j, k" , which interpenetrate in a manner at once remarkably simple, yet ex-
ceedingly rich from a modeler's vantage), in cloistered algebraic "safe-houses" whose
building blocks are the octahedral lattices of ZD's I call "box-kites."
         From here on out, I will have much less to say about physics per se, and much
more about mustering as a general NKS phenomenon. Indeed, the title of this presenta-
tion was submitted while I was still framing BK3 - but, much to my surprise, the physics
focus of the results presented therein took shape much more quickly than anticipated,
leading me to feel far less interested in regurgitating results just written up. So I only
note briefly two key themes. First, the algebraic "homomorphism" Moreno found was to
the automorphism group of the Octonions, known in Dynkin-diagram argot as "G2"; but
this is the same 7-fold-symmetric patterning which Dominic Joyce has used to model the
7 "curled up" dimensions of "gauge forces" in M-Theory - and this "Joyce manifold" is
built upon 35 equations. (Also the number of associative triplets in the Sedenions: the
Octonions have 7; the Quaternions, but 1; and 2N-ions in general have (2N-1)(2N-2)/(3!).)
Second, the breakdown of the "squares law" beyond the Octonions opens out on a way of
thinking surprisingly akin to renormalization: if the product of a pair of 2N-ions seems to
need the number of dimensions in which 2N+1-ions live, and if "look-alike" algebras incor-
porate "sleeper-cell structures" (i.e., dormant ZD's whose ZD-ness is unobservable as
such), with the same multiplication tables as Quaternions and Octonions, but with their
probabilistic nature implicit in (not superimposed upon) their workings . . . if such ideas
are of interest to you, please go to BK3. For I'll have no more to say about them here.
         What I do want from physics, to start with, is what one philosopher of science has
called a "remote analogy"9: one which, if not taken too literally, can help guide our
thoughts into the strange terrain we're entering. I refer to the cosmological notion which
has only been taken seriously for about 4 years now, known as "co-evolution." Since
John Kormandy's presentation at the June, 2000, AAS meeting, it has suddenly become a
mainstream notion to see supermassive black holes as "galactic sculptors" - that is,
necessary ingredients in galactic evolution, at least for elliptic galaxies like ours, with a
clear correlation between the size of the central black hole and the galaxy itself.10 I invite
you to jettison the "common wisdom" of ZD's as "pathological," and imagine an indefi-
nitely large (in theory, up to infinite-dimensional) space of ZD's - replete with a vast
potential for "mustering" and "demobilizing" structures, be they evanescent or long-term,
guided by a "dark matter halo" of NKS protocols still to be determined - as the "super-
massive black holes" which center and structure the galaxies of number.

2: The Theory of Everything: Starter-Kit Concepts
        BK3 ends with two pages presenting and generalizing from a "synchronization
table" displaying a fundamental property I call "trip-sync," for short for synchronization
of associative triplets (a.k.a., systems of mutually interpenetrating Quaternion copies).
Other phenomena (in particular, the "sand mandalas" in the 32-D "Pathions," whose
graphical sequencing in BK2 - reproduced below - was the first clue to NKS behaviors)
suggested complexity in the NKS sense. But the "spin control" implicit in the "slippage"
between triplets sharing Box-Kite pathways shows us where it's hiding and what it feeds
on. As happens surprisingly often in mathematics, being an inch away from a Big Idea
can feel like a mile until you get there, so while the closing thought in BK3 was that it
was an open question whether the Trip-Sync property holds for ZD patterns in all 2n-ions,
n > 3, it turned out to be embarrassingly easy to prove it in full generality, using nothing
much more than the defining properties of Box-Kite lattices themselves. So Trip-Sync's
deployment will mark the end-point of the presentation here of the "starter-kit concepts"
- after which, the "work in progress" of "mustering theory" proper can be broached.
        To get to a point where "trip-sync" will seem a natural thing to contemplate, we
need to consider, first, notation; next, the Cayley-Dixon Process (or CDP), the algorithm
which allows us to build 2N+1-ions from 2N-ions for N arbitrarily large; then, Box-Kites
themselves, which the right notation will make easy to explain, and ensembles of which,
in higher-than-16 dimensions, CDP machinery will let us investigate and navigate with
minimal pain.
        While the Quaternions have but two distinct representations, hence two labeling
schemes (ij = k, or ik = j), the Octonions have no fewer than 480, and the Sedenions a
few hundred billion. Nor are all the Octonionic schemes simply "equivalent" in all situa-
tions; nor are arbitrary labeling schemes for the Sedenions necessarily useful or even
feasible for our purposes. (For details, see BK1.) Some culling is in order, and a guiding
principle to motivate it. It is found in an outrageously simple-minded convention -
highly suggestive, in formal outline, of the definition of "norm" governing number forms
less "hyper" than Sedenions: for the 2N units in a given universe of 2N-ions, label their
axes with subscripts running from 0 (for the reals) to 2N-1, so that products of two such
units will have indices equal to the XOR of the indices of their factors. This is not only
do-able for all N, but simple to work with to boot.
        For the Quaternions, the rule is trivial: instead of i, j, k, write i1 , i2 , i3; and, since
1 xor 2 = 3, the product of any pair of axes yields the third. What's not so trivial is the
sign, though, of the resultant unit. And since, with the Octonions, multiple labeling
schemes conforming to our XOR rule are possible (and actually in use), we choose that
one which results from the most straightforward deployment of CDP. For more than you
probably care to know about this algorithm, see the background discussion and "bit-twid-
dling" proofs in BK2. For now, I'll just provide a standard, readily generalized, way of
writing Octonion triplets, then expand my interest to embrace the Sedenion multiplication
table; the iterative procedure one can point to in moving from the one to the other will
suggest a very simple set of rules (even dumber than those I reduced things to in BK2) for
any 2N-ion tabulations, which I'll describe in ready-to-implement pseudocode fashion.


R. de Marrais                                 Page 4                 "Something From Nothing"
        As composing strings of subscripted "i"'s is quite tedious, let's just write the
indices in comma-delimited, parenthesized lists of 3, in cyclical order. Put the lowest
index number first, then the index whose product with it yields the positive value of the
third. The Quaternions' "i, j, k" hence gets signified this way: (1, 2, 3). The seven
associative triplets (henceforth, "O-trips") found in the Octonions are written thus:

              (1, 2, 3); (1, 4, 5); (1, 7, 6); (2, 4, 6); (2, 5, 7); (3, 4, 7); (3, 6, 5)

         Note two things: first, each such triplet is clearly "XOR compliant" per my ear-
lier remarks - scanning the list right to left, 3 xor 6 ( = 011 xor 110 = 101) = 5; 3 xor 4
( = 011 xor 100 = 111) = 7; ... Second, this particular mode of XOR compliance displays
2 triplets (bolded in red) where counting and cyclical orders differ: (1, 7, 6) and (3, 6, 5)
yield the wrong signs as we cycle through their products if we write them (1, 6, 7) and (3,
5, 6). Labelings are possible (and actually in use among some physicists) where only one
triplet is written "out of order"; it is not possible, however, to come up with a labeling
where counting order and product signing are in accord in all 7 instances.
         The Sedenions include the 7 O-trips, but also contain 28 other associative triplets
(henceforth, "S-trips") which I now list (again red-bolding those "out of order"):

       (1, 8, 9)                 (1, 11, 10)               (1, 13, 12)               (1, 14, 15)
       (2, 8, 10)                (2, 9, 11)                (2, 14, 12)               (2, 15, 13)
       (3, 8, 11)                (3, 10, 9)                (3, 15, 12)               (3, 13, 14)
       (4, 8, 12)                (4, 9, 13)                (4, 10, 14)               (4, 11, 15)
       (5, 8, 13)                (5, 12, 9)                (5, 10, 15)               (5, 14, 11)
       (6, 8, 14)                (6, 15, 9)                (6, 12, 10)               (6, 11, 13)
       (7, 8, 15)                (7, 9, 14)                (7, 13, 10)               (7, 12, 11)

         For the first column only, all triplets display both counting and signing order, so
that the xor of the smaller pair of indices is identical to their sum. This is directly related
to the workings of CDP: for the key is the middle term in each, namely 8 = 23. The unit
corresponding to this index is the CDP generator: in general, to get 2N+1-ions from their
predecessor 2N-ions, you affix a unit of index 2N and produce 2N-1 triplets as above. All
such generator-containing triplets are, from the vantage of ZD creation, sterile. Indeed, it
is this sterility which leads to the very simple production rule for creating arbitrary zero-
divisors: take any arbitrary Octonion of index o (7 choices); then take any Sedenion of
index S, such that S is neither 8 nor the xor of o with 8 (6 choices); the diagonal lines in
the ( o, S ) plane (one of the 7<U+00B7>6 = "42 Assessors") will have all their points be ZD's.
         The tricky part is figuring out which diagonals zero-divide with which. This is
quite different from the situation found in standard QM, where a special (and, from our
purview, degenerate) case of ZD's has a crucial role to play. If we de-reify the usual
operator formalism to reveal the "inner number theory" trying to get out, we can see that
the "projection operators" underwriting spin-up vs. spin-down options, for instance, are
idempotents which just happen to mutually annihilate each other when multiplied (i.e.,
they're ZD's with respect to each other). They define two diagonal lines, with each point
of one zero-dividing each point of the other. Now let's say this again, in simpler English.

R. de Marrais                                  Page 5                    "Something From Nothing"
         We know that a Complex "line" is really a plane; the product of two such lines,
then, is really a 4-space. This space is not navigated by the Quaternions, since it's pro-
duced by 2 real axes and 2 imaginaries; but: in one of the great magic acts of modern
mathematics, this "bicomplex" 4-space (as navigated by the "unitary rotation group"
"SU2") is isomorphic to the Quaternions. The "bicomplex" space is also the simplest
interesting case of the general associative vector space called a Clifford algebra (the one
dubbed "Cl2," since it has 22 dimensions, to be precise). Its axes include the usual real
and imaginary; but the other two are "mirror numbers" (they square to +1, not - 1), and a
form of i which operates commutatively on the other axes' units. This last is represented
by 2 x 2 matrices with the usual i replacing the 1's in the identity matrix. And since
Wolfgang Pauli's day, the "mirror numbers" (one kind corresponding to each Quaternion
unit) have been represented by the trio of 2 x 2 "Pauli spin matrices." (All 3 of these, plus
the Quaternions, plus the "commutative imaginaries," together span the 8-D space called
"Cl3"; we won't be needing to know about this here, though, fortunately!)
        If we signify "mirror numbers" by the letter m, then the standard projection opera-
tors can be written thus: <U+00BD>(1 + m). It's easy to show that, for each of these quantities,
raising it to any arbitrary power leaves it unchanged; hence, each operates along its diago-
nal in the (1, m) plane like the '1' on the real axis - which is to say, it's idempotent. It's
also easy to see that their product (and hence that of any point on the one diagonal times
any on the other) displays nilpotency as well, since (1 + m)(1 - m) = 1 + m - m - 1 = 0.
        The diagonals of the 42 planes I've called "Assessors" in the Sedenions are like-
wise ZD's, but with a difference: they never mutually zero-divide, and they only zero-
divide with points on one or the other (but never both) diagonals in some other Assessors.
And we can narrow this down further: they only zero-divide with four other Assessors, in
such a manner that points on the "\" diagonal in one will zero-divide with points on one
of another Assessor's diagonals, while the "/" diagonal will zero-divide with the other.
        More specific yet: unlike "projection operators," which always come in pairs,
Assessor planes containing mutually zero-dividing diagonals come in threes. And, since
each Assessor participates in two such (otherwise unconnected) trios, it turns out that the
simplest layout is actually the one followed: i.e., the ZD activity of each Assessor is con-
strained within an octahedral arrangement of four "Co-Assessor trios," where each vertex
represents an Assessor plane, and the trios only share vertices, not edges, with each other.
        Note, too, the "edge signs," indicating which diagonals form ZD's with which,
when two Assessors joined by an edge are considered: if diagonals must have the same
orientation (" \ <U+00B7> \ " or " / <U+00B7> / "), mark the edge "+"; otherwise, write "- ". Then color in
the 4 triangles whose edges form "closed cycles" (for vertices A, B, C, each Assessor
pairing "emanates" the third: e.g., ( SA , oA ) <U+00B7> ( SB , oB ) = + ( SC , oC ) - ( SC , oC ) = 0) and
call them "Sails." Call the other 4 "Vents," and you get an octahedral "Box-Kite" which
can fly in Sedenion winds. 7 such, all isomorphic, partition the 42 Assessors, each taking
6; from these simple structures, the entire "pathology" of Sedenion ZD's can be grasped.
        The monicker "Box-Kite" is further justified by the fact that while the real-world
variety have wooden struts separating opposite vertices, thereby creating support and sta-
bility sufficient to let them fly, "struts" provide the crucial ingredient in our ethereal Box-
Kites as well: the 3 pairs of Assessors joined by "struts" do not mutually zero-divide!

         Struts have another major property: products of all 3 "strut pairs" in a Box-Kite
obey the same pattern; the (o, S) multiplications always yield the generator (the index-8
unit in the Sedenions); the (o, o) and (S, S) pairings, though, always result in the "missing
Octonion" (since an Octonion index resides at each vertex, of which there are 6, one must
be absent!) which serves as the signature, or "strut constant," of the Box-Kite in question.
To differentiate it from an index proper, I write it with a Roman numeral, as shown in the
left-most column in the "Strut Table" above.
         The 12 "edge-signs," drawn above right on the Box-Kite, evenly divide between
"+" and "- "; but "- "'s cluster in such a manner as to form the edges of two opposite
faces of the octahedron, one of which is a Vent, the other a Sail. The convention here is
to assume this Sail is ABC (making its corresponding Vent DEF). This special Sail I call
the "Zigzag," since traversing the edges so that one always "makes zero" creates a 6-cycle
of flipflopped traversals: multiply mutual ZD's from A and B, then B and C, then C and
A, and begin, say, with the "\"; the lines picked will keep switching like this: "\ / \ / \ /".
         Let's make this concrete: consider the Zigzag of Box-Kite I. Start with the "/"
diagonal in A's plane (which the table tells us is spanned by i3 and i10 ), and proceed as just
indicated. Here's the actual 6-cycle of ZD products (ignoring constants, since any points
on the indicated lines will serve as well as any others):
                           (i3 + i10)(i6 - i15) = (i6 - i15)(i5 + i12) = (i5 + i12)(i3 - i10) =
                        (i3 - i10)(i6 + i15) = (i6 + i15)(i5 - i12) = (i5 - i12)(i3 + i10) = 0.

        The other 3 Sails (ADE, FCE and FDB) all have 2 "+"'s and just one "- " for
edge-signs. Their 6-cycle patterns - "\ \ \ / / /" or "/ / / \ \ \" - suggest the knots they're
named for: Trefoils. This Zigzag/Trefoil difference is the basis of the Trip-Sync property;
all we need do now is consider the O-trips and S-trips which Sails are made of, and "blow
up" each Sail into a kindred "Box-Kite" layout. Only on these, "Sails" now represent the
4 distinct triplets weaving through a Co-Assessor trio, with the sole O-trip cast in the
"Zigzag" role, and the 3 (o, S) pairs which span Assessor planes bounding the "struts."

R. de Marrais                                           Page 7                         "Something From Nothing"
         This is much easier to follow by seeing it than hearing it described. So let's take
as for-instance the Zigzag of Box-Kite I. Its 3 Assessors' ( o, S ) pairs have the indices
given in the prior page's "Strut Table": (3, 10); (6,15); and (5, 12). The 3 o's comprise
one of the standard O-trips; but the "recursive Box-Kite" described last paragraph (or
"Rbox" for short) shows that each of these 3 o's forms an S-trip with the other two trio
members' Sedenions. Hence (3, 15, 12); (10, 6, 12); (10, 15, 5) - written in A, B, C order
with the Octonions in bold - are all S-trips we can find in the listings given above.
        Two differences should be noted between a Sedenion Box-Kite ("Sbox") and the
Rboxes one can build on its Sails. First, "double covering": the Sbox "Sails" are 6-
cycles, those of an Rbox are 3-cycles. Second, "mutual mirroring": the orientation of the
cycling (as indicated by the arrows inscribed along the diagram's edges) is reversed when
one moves between Rbox and Sbox representations. This is a side-effect of two things
which are ultimately the same thing: "bit-twiddling" (pure Sedenions must be written
with an extra bit when we XOR them, so that the XOR of two S's is always an o); and,
diagonal skewing (the Sbox places S-terms, which flow with the o-term's cycle in the
Sbox, on the other end of the strut the o and S terms span in the Rbox).
        The "mutual mirroring," then, is an artefact of the Rbox representation. But it
serves to indicate the nature of the property we're after: for orientation-reversal is what
Trip-Sync is all about. Reverting to the Sbox we started with, the o's at each vertex of a
Sail belong to 2 different triplets; in the Zigzag's case, irregardless of the added "weight"
the S-trips carry (an extra bit to the left when we write their indices in binary), the orien-
tation is unchanged as we move from O-trip to S-trip. Hence, we could imagine a sort of
"slippage" as we define Quaternionic orbits deformable into the simple i,j,k cycling round
ABC, wherein the extra bit is "added" or "dropped" without our being cognizant of that
fact. If the two orientations be thought akin to QM-like "spin up" vs. "spin down," we
could even claim there was an "infobarrier" forbidding us to detect which case obtained.
        We cannot say the same, though, in the general case: for, with Trefoils, S-trip to
O-trip "slippage" causes a reversal of orientation, whenever the o shared between them is
not one of the Zigzag's trio (i.e., 2 times out of 3). Consider, for instance, the ADE Sail
in Box-Kite I. Writing the S-trips per above (with O-trip components in bold), we get
this: (3, 13, 14); (10, 4, 14); (10, 13, 7), with each triplet in A, D, E order. A quick look
at the earlier listing indicates that the second and third of these are written in backwards
order, whereas the first (which shares the 3 with ABC) can be "let slip" without our notic-
ing it. This is the ground floor, then, of observability (and, as such, bears a deep relation-
ship to Penrose's "spin networks: a topic for another time). What is more, it holds true
for all Box-Kites, in all 2N-ions. This is the Trip-Sync property. Proving it is easy.
        Let's write any S index using uppercase, and any o in lowercase; let's further write
"sg" to designate a binary variable equal to +1. Then any Assessors (K, k) and (L, l), if
joined by an edge-sign marked "-", will have product (K + sg<U+00B7>k) <U+00B7> (L - sg<U+00B7>l) = (KL - sg<U+00B7>Kl
+ sg<U+00B7>kL - kl) = 0. Since KL and kl = o's, and Kl and kL = S's, then KL = kl = m, and Kl =
kL = M, where (M, m) is the third Assessor in the Sail. If the edge-sign be "+," then the
opposite obtains: KL = -kl = -m, so S-trip (K, L, m) has opposite sense from O-trip (k,
l, m). Since the edge-signs leading out from a Zigzag vertex in a Trefoil must be "+," the
edge opposite said vertex in the Trefoil will be marked "-"; hence only the lone S-trip in
this Trefoil which includes a Zigzag o will "let things slide." (QED - no kidding!)

R. de Marrais                              Page 8               "Something From Nothing"
         This may not seem like such a big deal: at least, not within the Sedenions. But as
early as the 32-D Pathions, larger ensembles present themselves - seven Box-Kite septets
I call "Pl<U+00E9>iades" emerge, which interconnect 14 Assessors, each of which belongs to 3
Box-Kites and 6 Sails. Sharing these properties but not others is the "middleman" be-
tween them and the "Sand Mandalas," which I call the "Muster Master." Each of its 7
Box-Kite Zigzags is exclusively mapped to an O-trip - which means, if we treat "spin-
flips" as units of attractive or repulsive force, the Muster Master can round up (or chase
off) any and all Sedenion Box-Kites by an extension of Trip-Sync slippage.
        Given its unique holding capacity (harboring 1 copy each of every O- and S-trip
appearing in any Sedenion Box-Kite), the Muster Master effectively serves, then, as a
Pathion "Atlas" for all ZD patterns on the other side of the 24-ion/25-ion divide. Given,
further, that the word derives from the name of the Titan in Greek myth who kept the
earth and heavens separated by brute strength - and who also fathered the seven sisters
called the "Pl<U+00E9>iades" - we could even say "Atlas" is the "Muster Master"'s proper name!
        If we assume, as well, that Box-Kites are free-floating, each with its own copy of
(or window on) Zero, and its own clones of appropriate 2N-ion units acting as "internal
coordinates," wild "population dynamics," with all sorts of "clumpings" and "schisms" in
evidence, suggest themselves. Further, given the simplicity of the latticework connecting
Assessors and their composites, and the binary nature of the "spin control" we can put in
play among them, the simplest approach to their study seems to mandate NKS setups.
The final pages will provide broad and sharp-edged guidelines for pursuing them.
        The remainder of this presentation will be focused on three tasks. First, if we
must (rather literally) "redouble" our efforts by moving from Sedenions to higher reaches
(to the 32-D Pathions at least, where "Sand Mandalas," "Pl<U+00E9>iades," and the "Muster Mas-
ter" live), we'll need to redeem an earlier promissory note, and provide some "pseudo-
code"-level detail concerning general 2N-ion multiplication. Next, we'll probe the pheno-
mena just alluded to in 32-D, wherein NKS patterns respectively were first suspected, and
NKS tactics seem most clearly motivated. Then we'll hone in on a surprisingly deep con-
nection between ZD's and Boolean logic, which I'm only beginning to grasp myself -
which will lead me to rough-sketch a promising possibility for fusion of methods.
        At April's conference, my own poster was situated a few feet away from Rodrigo
Obando's in the presentation gallery, and what I gathered of his work from discussions
there and later surprised and excited me. Certain "magic numbers" were common to both
our approaches, for reasons neither of us clearly understands yet. The order of the second
"simple group," 168, plays a critical role in his Boolean-function approach toward gener-
ating (r = 2) NKS complexity from logical "first principles" (it's the number of both iso-
and anti- tone functions with 4 variables, a result which goes all the way back to Dede-
kind). In my own eliciting of ZD "head counts," 42 Assessors implies168 oriented lines
of ZD's, as well as the same number of "edge currents" (2 per edge, 12 edges per Box-
Kite), both echoing the order of PSL(2,7), the finite projective triangle which houses
Octonion labeling schemes - and pops up again when investigating fixed "strut-constant"
slices of the Pathion pie . . . about which, I can't say anything further until I've deployed
the arguments just promised. But I can say that such surprising "hybrid fusion," between
such disparate points of view, is what conferences like NKS 2004 are meant to facilitate.
What better theme, then, could present itself for bringing these pages to a close?

 3: Revisiting the CDP Algorithm; Invading the 32-D of the Pathions
         Let's return to the scene of the crime: the triplet listings on page 5. Recall that the
first of the 4 columns of S-trips has all its length-3 lists in counting and signing order (be-
cause the '8' in the middle is the generator). What to make of the apparently random way
disordered lists display in the columns to the right? Reading from the left, there are 4, 5,
and 3 in successive columns: half the 28 "8-less" O- and S- trips. Where is the pattern in
this? The answer is found in the relation of the rows (one per o) to the 3 O-trips implicit,
via "slippage," in the o-harboring S-trips listed across each row's "8-less" columns.
         If you left-multiply i8 by any io, you get + i(8+o) - which is an S. Likewise, multi-
plying i8 on the left by any S will yield a negative o - of index (S - 8). Apply this obvious
logic to the triplets on the left, operating on those in the rows whose leading o's form an
O-trip. In the cycle (1, 2, 3), two consecutive terms have xor equal to the third, with pos-
itive sign; the rightmost terms in the same rows, though, while not forming a cycle as
written, imply one upon xoring and sign-flipping. Paralleling 2 xor 3 = 1, we have 10 xor
11 = 1, but with sign reversed. Whence the S-trip at the top of the 1st column, (1, 11, 10).
By cycling according to the same logic, (3 xor 1 = 11 xor 9 = 2) <U+2192> (2, 9, 11), and (1 xor 2
= 9 xor 10 = 3) <U+2192> (3, 10, 9). By proceeding similarly with (1, 4, 5), rows 1 of the 2nd
column, and rows 4 and 5 of the 1st, get filled in, while working with (1, 7, 6) completes
the 1st row and 1st column. Conducting the same sort of business with the next two O-
trips - (2, 4, 6) and (2, 5, 7) - suffices to finish the tabulation.
         This procedure can be extended to 2N-ions, N any integer: just replace 8 with the
appropriate generator, g = 2N-1, and create a first column with g - 1 triplets, one per row.
The number of columns will correspond to the number of L- (no longer just O-) trips,
where L indicates indices lower than g (with U indicating those we'd now signify with
uppercase lettering, the way we used S for Sedenion indices > 8, which indices appear in
U-trips). For the Pathions, this means 7 columns to the right - the number of Octonion
units. For 2N-ions generally, the number of columns to the right of the g-containing one
equals the count of imaginary units in the 2N-2-ions: 0 for H, 1 for O; 3 for S; 7 for P...
         This table-building strategy is not only easy to implement, but it's a lot simpler
than the way the CDP algorithm is typically explained - which means, perhaps, it should
be dubbed the "Fast CDP." And it also suggests a table-free method for calculating the
products of any two imaginaries of arbitrary indices. It can be summarized in 3 rules:
         Triple Negatives Rule: For the general product of two units whose indices are r
and c (for row and column, where we read off the left- and right-hand terms to the multi-
plication in an imagined table of product indices, ranging from 0 to 2N+1 - 1), if both are
less than the generator g = 2N, the value in cell (r, c) of the table = r<U+00B7>c. If one term > g (it
doesn't matter which), the index and sign of their product is just [-(2N + r<U+00B7>c)]. If both
terms > g, XOR-ing kills the 2N, leaving just [-r<U+00B7>c].
         Trident Rule: Multiplying g on the left (right) by any unit whose index > g re-
sults in a unit whose index is their sum, with same (opposite) sign. Diagonal entries in
quadrants of the table (the result of products where r = c) are + g below the main diagonal
(whose "index 0" entries, all squares of imaginaries, evaluate to -1), and - g above it (but
for the 1st row, which is just the trivial, all-positive, products with the real unit).
         Recursive Bottoming: Successive use of these two rules resolves all products.

R. de Marrais                              Page 10                "Something From Nothing"
          The reader is encouraged to pore over the Sedenion multiplication table, the better
to see how it conforms to these rules, taking g variously as 1, 2 or 3. A version with
checkerboard shading, to make two levels of "quadrants" easier to see, can be reached by
clicking the "BK1" URL in the 3rd endnote and going to page 6. As a way to gain rapid
entry into higher dimensions, however, the reader is invited to consider another rule,
which can generate properly signed triplets in arbitrarily high dimension.
         Zero-Stuffing: Insert 0's in the same position in the binary representation of a
triplet, and you'll get another, similarly signed. Taking the H-spanning triplet (1, 2, 3)
and stuffing 0's to the right, then the middle, yields the O-trips (2, 4, 6) and (1, 4, 5). This
plus the sign-flipping effect of adding 1-bits to the left of, then xoring, doublets - (1, 2);
(2, 3); (3, 1) giving (3, 6, 5); (1, 7, 6); (2, 5, 7) - yields up all the O-trips save (3, 4, 7).
         Zero-stuffing can generate an infinite series of "harmonics" of any given triplet;
and, by extension, it can give us a similarly infinite "overtone series" of Box-Kites. This
fact, plus a simple generalization of the "strut constant" notion, makes generating and
classifying Box-Kites in the Pathions fairly straightforward (up to a point, as I'll shortly
spell out). Take the four O-trips of one of the seven Sedenion Box-Kites, and make them
the L-trips for a "base-line" Pathion Box-Kite by stuffing a zero to the right of the left-
most 1-bit in each Assessor's S term: the strut constant remains unchanged, but the S
terms become U terms, with indices increased by 8.
         In the Sedenions, though, each strut constant, by dint of being a "missing Octon-
ion," implicated 3 pairs of strut-opposite Assessors (one per each O-trip containing it).
But 7 S-trips contain the Octonion, and each of these must be accommodated when we set
about constructing Box-Kites in the Pathions. The upshot is that each strut constant now
collects 7 Box-Kites, as there are now 24-2 Assessors to choose from: each of these will
zero-divide all but itself and its strut-opposite, for 168 ZD products - and, as the 4 Sails
of a Box-Kite each mandate 6 such products, we get 168 / 24 = 7 Box-Kites in all.
         Consider the 4 Pathion L-trips which are S-trips, associated with strut constant s =
1: (1, 8, 9); (1, 11, 10); (1, 13, 12); (1, 14, 15). We get 8 Assessors out of them by first
throwing away the 1's, then taking one of the remaining terms as given, and adding a 1-bit
to the left of the other: (8, 25) and (9, 24) form a pair of strut-opposites, as do (11, 26)
and (10, 27); (13, 28) and (12, 29); and (14, 31) and (15, 30). We then build Zigzags by
keeping one O-strut, moving it into the A, F slots if not there to start with, and picking
two S-trip Assessors among the four pair just listed which form L-trips at (A, B, C) and
(A, D, E). Zero-stuffing and 1-bit appending make picking and arranging fairly easy.
         For instance, keeping with the ongoing example, the L-terms at the vertices for the
base-line Box-Kite with s = 1 are (3, 6, 5, 4, 7, 2). Keep 3 and 2 at A and F: appending
8's to the left of the (B, C), then (D, E), terms reverses their order, giving us this new
Box-Kite: (3, 13, 14, 15, 12, 2). Stuffing zeros to the left of the 21 bit, meanwhile, keeps
terms in their places, but changes the L-terms at the vertices to read this way: (3, 10, 9, 8,
11, 3). Rotating the (B, E) and (C, D) L-pairs to (A, F) scrambles the ordering a bit, but
the same basic principle applies: with (6, 5) at (A, F), the "L-bit trick" gives us (after
some rearrange) this list: (6, 11, 13, 12, 10, 7); the second Box-Kite with (6, 5) on the A-
F strut, though, requires both tricks to isolate an appropriate match with the right S-trip
Assessors: zero-stuffing sends (5, 4) to (9, 8); but applying the "L-bit trick" twice is
required to send (3, 2) to (15, 14), the last available S-trip Assessors.

R. de Marrais                               Page 11               "Something From Nothing"
          This last example suggests a problem: with the Sedenions, s ranges from 1 to 7 -
this last being one less than the generator, g. For the Pathions, g = 16, so there are 15
values possible for s. But one of these = the Sedenions' g (which we might call the Path-
ions' "subgenerator," g-1), and 7 exceed it. If multiple "L-bit trick" applications are need-
ed frequently, might we not risk "carry-bit overflow" as s grows? The answer is yes.
         The reference four paragraphs back to a 14 x 14 multiplication table is not quite
exact, since the product of mutual ZD's, strictly speaking, is zero by definition. To be
informative, the table's cells show emanations: per the earlier definition, diagonals of
Assessors which mutually act as ZD's in fact engage in "pair production" of two opposite-
ly signed copies of the third Assessor in their Sail. The L-term index for this third Asses-
sor is what's shown in the "emanation table," with an underbar if the edge-sign joining its
producing Assessors (whose L-term indices are shown on the row and column headings)
is "-". Such a table has blank diagonals (since Assessors never make ZD's between their
own diagonals, or with those of their strut-opposite), hence 142 - 2<U+00B7>14 = 168 filled-in
cells. When s = g-1, though, the edge-signs cluster so that all cells in the upper left and
lower right quadrants are "-", while those in the opposite quadrants are all "+".
         When s > g-1, however, the ZD population suddenly collapses: only 72 cells are
filled in in each, meaning 3, not 7, Box-Kites. Consider the first such case (s = 9):

                                  A      B       C       D      E        F
Base-Line Box-Kite:            (2, 27) (8, 17) (10,19) (3, 26)(1, 24) (11, 18)
"First Harmonic":              (4, 29) (8, 17) (12,21) (5, 28)(1, 24) (13, 20)
"Second Harmonic":             (7, 30) (8, 17) (15,22) (6, 31)(1, 24) (14, 23)

        It is tempting to assume the 6 Assessors arrayed in the columns D and A, after
minor rearrangement, form another in the "overtone series" of our s = 1 "baseline Box-
Kite": but "carrybit overflow" is at work, so that left-appending 1-bits to all U-terms -
converting (3, 10) into (3, 10+16 = 26) and so on, thereby reversing signs on all 3 mem-
bers (an odd number) of each triplet - suffices, in this case, to kill off all the ZD's we'd
expect to see. Just as surprising, the triplet (1, 8, 9), "sterile" in the Sedenion context,
provides the doublet from which the Assessors that triply repeat at B and E are fabricated.
        A mystery, finally, is placed before us when the 7 (s > g-1 ) tables, collectively
dubbed "Sand Mandalas" after the Tibetan meditative drawings they resemble, are view-
ed in "flip-book" style: while the (o, 8, o+s) repeaters cluster inside the array, all other
emanations are confined to the perimeter, with this square's edges pulling back in unison
from the table's boundaries by one cell with each increment to s (while the "repeaters"
reconfigure), until we're left in the last still-shot with a 2-cell-thick cross whose ends are
joined up by the "repeaters" - which have rearranged themselves into diagonals.
        It was this behavior (whose necessity was proven, after the fact of stumbling on it,
explicitly via elaborate bit-twiddling in "BK2" on p. 16) which first suggested something
like cellular automata at work. More peculiar still, if one folds the table over like a hand-
kerchief, along both horizontal and vertical midlines, the L-terms in the "shrinking box"
coalesce to form the O- and S- terms of the 6 Assessors in the Sedenion Box-Kites whose
strut constants = the differences of the table's s and g-1 terms ( i.e., 1 - 7); the "repeaters,"
meanwhile, coalesce to form the "forbidden doublet" of the Sedenion Box-Kite's s and g!

     "Muster Master" and "Sand Mandala" Emanation Tables (s = 8 through 15)




         The above graphics are reproduced from p. 15 of "BK2," and should be read from
left to right, top to bottom: the first "emanation table" is for s = 8; the last, for s = 15.
Rows, columns, and cell contents show L-index numbers of the associated Assessors in
hex (since values range from 1 to 15). Rows and columns are further arranged so that
strut-opposites appear in "nested parentheses" format, in otherwise ascending order, as
with the earlier Sedenion strut table. Since diagonals will always be empty of emanations,
they are simply left blank; in all but the first table, the majority of non-diagonal cells are
also unfilled, and these are left empty, but with light gray background. Cells which form
into the 3 Box-Kites' (o, 8, 8+o) "repeaters" are daubed green; the others are painted red.
         As one might expect, as the N in 2N-ion increases, "carry-bit overflow" becomes
even more pronounced, with patterns that look progressively more "fractal" than those
shown: at high s, as cells become more numerous, boundaries become crenelated, and
box-kites even break up into pieces. It is unclear what happens for very large N: does the
density of ZD's <U+2192> 0 as N <U+2192> <U+221E>? Would that imply (and quite counterintuitively) that
high-s , high-N spaces become "tame," perhaps with something like a Hilbert space as a
limit; or, do they instead "merely" become unwieldy and chaotic? Abolutely nothing is
know at present - including whether or not these are good questions!
         The heading for the graphics indicates that the "Muster Master" is also on display.
Clearly, it's the upper leftmost, s = 8, table: ironically, the same index plagued with ZD-
sterility when it's the generator becomes the most "omnivoyant" of all configurations
when it is "demoted" to subgenerator status in the next round of CDP expansionism. Pre-
cisely because it's excluded, all the Octonions are included among the L-trips - leading to
7 Box-Kites each of whose Zigzag has an O-trip for lower indices . . . meaning "slippage"
between U-trips and O-trips could be effected "ionically" or "covalently" between the
Muster Master and any Sedenion Box-Kite, and in an"unobservable" manner, thanks to
Zigzag involvement. But Sedenion S-trips can be Pathion L-trips, so "bonding" is subtle.


R. de Marrais                             Page 13               "Something From Nothing"
         We could, in fact, describe the situation, using the argot of object-oriented pro-
gramming, as perfect "design-hiding": for while the o's in the ABC positions (and hence,
the Zigzag) of each Sedenion Box-Kite exactly match the Zigzag L-trip of exactly one of
the 7 component Box-Kites of the Muster Master, it is the S's in the former's DEF posi-
tions which get promoted to L-trip status in the latter. Hence, Trefoil L-trips "resonate"
with the U-trips of the lower-order Box-Kites - but only with those that share their sing-
leton o with the Zigzag! The Muster Master Box-Kite which shares Zigzag L-trips with a
given Sedenion Box-Kite cannot have its actions observed at all from the latter's purview.
        This is not the whole story, though: in Sedenion Box-Kite IV, for instance, the S-
trip (13, 11, 6) - which we'll write (A, D, e) to obey our casing convention - "resonates"
with (f, d, b) of the Muster Master's Zigzag-match to Sedenion Box-Kite I, and this inter-
action is a Trip-Sync "observable." Below is a synthesis of data from the "Synchroniza-
tion Table By Box-Kite and Sail" on the penultimate page of "BK3," and the component
Box-Kites of the Muster Master, listed by their Sedenion Zigzag-matches' strut constants
(shorthanded "ZM#" in the table). Note that vertex locations are rotated ( <U+00AE> ) in 4 of the
7 Muster Master components: this affects labeling (e.g., Trefoils might switch places and
their cyclings shift in phase), but not triplet orientation, and so can be ignored.

        Before analyzing the results of the table above, some backgrounding concerning
the Muster Master is in order, the better to make the results we'll be discussing seem all
the sharper. For completeness' sake, here's a listing of the full set of the Muster Master's
14 Assessors, showing both L- and U- indices, with strut-pairs arrayed vertically:

       (1, 25)   ( 2, 26)    ( 3, 27)   ( 4, 28)    ( 5, 29)   ( 6, 30)    ( 7, 31)
       (9, 17)   (10, 18)    (11, 19)   (12, 20)    (13, 21)   (14, 22)    (15, 23)

        The utter simplicity of this deployment belies the complexities implied in the
table. It would greatly aid intuition to have some way to picture the synergy between the
7 component Box-Kites of this highly symmetric "father" to the Pathion "Pl<U+00E9>iades,"
whose 7 "nymph" Assessors with o's for L-terms nicely echo the 7 "stars" with L-term S's
who form their strut-partners. The two descriptive pieces of this last sentence each will
lead us to investigate a different graphical depiction. Let's begin, first of all, with a way
to envision 14 Assessors, each in 3 of the 7 "cleanly partitioned" Box-Kites (by which I
mean, no edges are shared between them), appearing thereby in twice 3 = 6 Sails. The
following is lifted from a paper describing "octahedral fractal" models12 - a topic which
has no direct bearing here, although the graphic fits our themes perfectly.
        We can scan this as 7 stacks of 3 Box-Kites- 3 trios including the central one, and
4 more joined by the dashed lines. Assume stacking suggestive of a voltaic pile for the
centrally coordinated sets: if the Assessor at the top of the vertical stack, for instance, is
"A," it would be replaced in its position in the next-lower Box-Kite by its strut-opposite,
"F," so that the sequence of descending labels for the trio would be this: A, F=F, A=A, F;
similarly for the perpendicular lines of Box-Kites in the central horizontal plane. For the
other 4 trios, assume vertices joined by dotted lines from the central squares are strut-op-
posites as well. There's a lot of rotating and translating you have to deal with to make a
                                          consistent labeling scheme; putting in indices, too,
                                putt p would induce a truly noxious degree of cluttering,
                                          so I won't even try. The idea, I hope, will suffice!
                                                  While this graphic, then, serves to present
                                          an image of the interconnectedness of Assessors
                                          in the Pl<U+00E9>iades scheme, it gives no clear feeling
                                          for Assessor-level detail: a way to picture the
                                          indices without the distraction of 3-D would be
                                          a useful thing. Here, we can adapt the tactic,
                                          mentioned in passing at the end of the last section,
                                          of representing triplets as intersecting lines, via
                                          finite projective groups: a "stereo" version of
                                          of the PSL(2,7) layout of labeling schemes for
                                          the Octonions which was championed by the late
                                          great Canadian geometer Harry Coxeter. The
                                          interrelations among indices for Atlas and his
                                          Pl<U+00E9>iades can be cleanly displayed in this manner,
                                          and "loop algebra" subtleties framed naturally, in
                                          their turn, by referencing these diagram-pairings.

R. de Marrais                             Page 15               "Something From Nothing"
                                       PSL(2,7) expresses the symmetries of the simplest non-
                                  trivial finite projective plane, known by Fano's name. In
                                  projective geometry, lines and circles are equivalent, so
                                  this diagram should be interpreted as comprising 7 lines,
                                  including the apparent "circle" in the middle. The lines
                                  intersect in 7 points, the Octonion units: the cross-overs
                                  with no nodes or labels are illusions of the projection
                                  process. In this elegant rendering (from Ref. 1, p. 46),
                                  Quaternion units are in lower case (the standard "i,j,k")
                                  and make the central cycle. The (index-4) generator is at
their circle's center, E. The triangle's vertices are just the products of their lower-case
equivalents with E, so that lines through E are oriented from lower to upper case letters.
Similarly, all three edges on the perimeter flow clockwise, while the central "i,j,k" flows
likewise. The symmetry group of this 2-D configuration of 7 lines, each being intersected
by 3 others (or equivalently, thanks to projective duality, 7 points, where each "cycle" is
determined by 3 of them) is just 7 x 3 x 23 (the number of possible signing conventions
per triplet), or 168. But this is precisely the total symmetry of "Box-Kite space" as well,
since we have 7 of them, each with 4 3-cycles or "Sails"(which means they obey the 24-
element rotational symmetry of their Octahedral container). If you have stereo glasses
available, you can "see" this from Buckland Polster's Fano Plane graphic from The Ma-
thematical Intelligencer 21 (1999) 38-43: here, the 7 "lines" are just the 3 Struts and 4
Sails, with the 7 "points" being the vertices plus the Zero (which we assume is "piped in"
to the centers of each Assessor-plane "screen" by Strut-connected "cable TV"!)




        What I have in mind here is another sort of "stereo," with the 14 Assessors in any
given Pl<U+00E9>iade being partitioned across two such layouts. Just as the PSL(2,7) triangle
above can have its letters removed and relabeled by myriad different indexing schemes,
with the arrows also having their orientations switched accordingly, so too with our
"stereo Fano" manner of showing Pl<U+00E9>iade symmetries. In the little table at the top of the
next page, I'll just give the index-number equivalents for the letters, and assume you can
figure out the O- trip and S-trip orientations without my help at this point.

        For all but "Atlas," the 7 L-trips in each line of the lefthand listing split up so that
4 of the component Box-Kites are represented by their Zigzags, and 3 (all and only those
containing an "8," always situated at "D") by their ADE Trefoils. This is the Pathions'
equivalent of the "Strut Table" provided for Sedenions. The fact that a fully functional
copy of PSL(2,7) can uniquely serve to integrate all a Pl<U+00E9>iade's Box-Kites (with its "sha-
dow" on the right providing "stereo vision" by housing, vertex by vertex, the lefthand
terms' strut opposites) gives striking proof of the Pleiades' fundamental synergies as en-
sembles: they are by no means loose affilations of independent entities, "cat-herded" op-
portunistically. (Exercise: draw all 7 Kites for each line, properly orienting the edges!)
        Now it is time to turn our attention, at last, to the "Trip-Sync Observables Table"
on Page 14. The first thing to stress is that there is an exact, one-to-one correspondence
between Sails on the Sedenion "receiving end" and the Pathion "sending end" of any
transactions between them: tautologically, each ZM# indicates a Zigzag-to-Zigzag
matchup of the "unobservable" kind; but there is also precisely one "unobservable" link-
up, from each Muster Master component's Trefoil Sail L-trip, to some specific S-trip in
some Sedenion Zigzag. And there are also precisely two "observable" connections from
Trefoil-based Muster Master L-trips to specific Sedenion Trefoil S-trips. Such extreme
orderliness and specialization of connection indicates we're dealing with a very stable,
well-articulated platform for doing something.
        But doing what, exactly? Here is where I see the next line of research, which will,
I hope, be ripe for presenting at NKS 2005. Viewed in full generality, we have this for a
setup: a latticework of connected Assessors, where Sedenion Box-Kites can "channel" a
quartet of independent inputs from the Pathions' "higher plane"; these inputs are effect-
ively binary, and there is one output, also binary. We have also seen, from many angles
now, the critical role of 168-fold symmetry in all these workings. It is at this point that
Rodrigo Obando's ongoing work13 on applying Boolean function theory to NKS systems
shouts for our attention: for there are 168 4-variable monotone functions, and the same
number of complements, which he first indicated at NKS 2003 can provide the key to
determining the classification of NKS behaviors displayed by arbitrary rules. His basic
tactic (and its clear "resonance" with ZD setups) goes like this.

R. de Marrais                              Page 17                "Something From Nothing"
          Split the bit representation of a rule into two "primitives." One string contains bits
indicative of an initial input combination that has the central cell's value = 0. The other
contains those telling what happens if said cell value = 1. For the (r=2) situation that
clearly obtains with the Trip-Sync linkup of Pathions to Sedenions, the possible rules
equal 2 raised to the (25 = ) 32nd power, which is more than 4 billion rules altogether -
an awful lot to have to wade through if we've no initial notion of which ones are Class 1
(boringly homogenous outcomes), which are Class 2 (evolving into simply separated peri-
odic structures), which yield up chaotic aperiodic patterns (Class 3), and which - the real
"money shot" here - generate truly complex "Class 4" patterns of localized structures.
         But Obando's work strongly suggests (with some specific examples to buttress his
claims) that we can, indeed, predict what sort of behavior a rule will display, and even say
which will be Class 4. First, partition a rule into "primitives," then see if their bit repre-
sentations are Boolean monotones. Because the "primitives" have half the string each,
this means we're dealing with the much more manageable count of 216 logical express-
ions, or 65,536 possibilities, that each "half-rule" can display. If the primitives are pro-
perly chosen from the two "monotonous" sets of 168 - each created recursively, by bit-
string and-ing and or-ing, out of Oneness and Nothing - we'll get Class 4 complexity.
         But meanwhile, we have two sets of 168 ZD "primitives," on opposite sides of the
Sedenion/Pathion "infobarrier": one, then, from each party to our "channeling." And
each Box-Kite "edge current," if encoded as a string of 0's and 1's, can be uniquely speci-
fied by precisely 16 bits. Consider it this way (and there are other ways as well): any
"successful" ZD product entails the involvement of 2 Assessors, which for the Sedenion
"target" (and isomorphically for Pathion "broadcaster") means 4 bits for each S index, 3
for each o, and 2 extra bits "left over." Suppose we say these latter determine the diago-
nals - "\ or /?" - as specified at the two ends of the connecting edge. (N.B.: the edge
sign's value itself is not an independent variable, so can't be counted!)
         Now we need to tweak this (or is it "kludge things up"?) a bit. The problem is,
stating just this much means we get two distinct strings for each "edge-current," depend-
ing upon which Assessor we write out first. But rather than get worked up about this
double-count of strings, let's make use of this implicit positional information, in this way:
if the first Assessor is "less than" the second (the o index is lower, say, or it has an earlier
birthday: it doesn't matter how, just that it's "less than"), then assume they both employ
the "/ " diagonal. If the first written down is the greater, however, assume " \ ". Next,
use the first of our leftovers for a "switch bit" in this sense: if "0," do nothing; if "1,"
switch the diagonal used by the second in sequence, not size. Which leaves us with one
last "extra" to interpret: I call this bit the "spigot," since I envision it as turning the
"edge-current" on or off - something I have trouble imagining not playing a role!
         And while the "168" in the ZD universe are most definitely not Boolean mono-
tone functions by any stretch of the imagination - their fundamental workings, after all,
are defined by XORing, which is not an allowable operation in monotone string-building
- there most definitely is very good reason to expect a rich harvest of transformations
between the two mathematical languages. Let me put this another way: even though I
don't carry an AARP card yet, I still can remember when the idea of "Chaotic number
theory" would have seemed too insane to bear contemplating; by the next NKS confer-
ence, I hope to make the case that the problem with that notion is, it's just too tame.

 1 I. L. Kantor and A. S. Solodovnikov, Hypercomplex Numbers: An Elementary Introduction to Algebras (Springer-
   Verlag: New York, 1989) provides an elegant introduction (aimed at "smart high school students" as these were
   understood in Soviet-era Moscow) to the whole theme of hypercomplex numbers, all building up to the formulation, in
   Chapter 17, of Hurwitz's 1896 proof that "Every normed algebra with an identity is isomorphic to one of following four
   algebras: the real numbers, the complex numbers, the quaternions, and the Cayley numbers."

   (3) 4:1 (1998), 13-28; http://arXiv.org/abs/q-alg/9710013. The key result was his finding that ZD's in the Sedenions
   obey a structure homomorphic to the Lie algebra indicated by the Dynkin Diagram "G2"; but homo- is not iso- morphic,
   and only a single concrete instance of a pair of ZD's was given . . . which led to my own radically constructivist, almost
   "punk-rock"-like simplicity of 3 production rules and one octahedral-lattice-based "box-kite" graphic to summarize the
   workings of the entirety of 16-D ZD's. (Moreno notes, too, that "G2" also implies a powerful scaling of results into
   higher 2N-D number forms, since "G2" - the automorphism group of the Octonions - is the "derivation algebra" of each
   2N+1-ion number system from the 2N-ions which generate it by the "Cayley-Dickson process."

4 R. E. Cawagas, "Loops Embedded in Generalized Cayley Algebras of Dimension 2r, r > 2," Int. J. Math. Math. Sci. 28:3
   (2001), 181-187. Prof. Cawagas' "Finitas" software, which he makes freely available, lets one calculate loops and other
   nonassociative structures rather easily in higher-dimensional contexts; he in fact found an equivalent manner of express-
   ing my tabulations from BK1 in "loop language," which he presented in a paper of this year to the National Research
   Council of the Philippines, "On the Structure and Zero Divisors of the Sedenion Algebra"; the correspondence which
   ensued after he communicated this to me proved delightfully engaging, and was the direct trigger for "BK3."
5 Trickier "squares rules," though, abound, as do esoteric algebras concerned with them, such as "Pfister forms"; A. R.
   Rajwade, in fact, has devoted a whole book to them: Squares (Cambridge U. P.: Cambridge UK, 1993). Using his
   convenient shorthand, the standard rules have form (2n, 2n, 2n) where n < 4; for 16-D, though, two 16-D numbers, com-
   prising 16 squares each, generally have a product representable by 32 squares (16, 16, 32). But stranger results are also
   possible: (9, 16, 16) and (10, 10, 16) also work - which may "mean something very significant" as far as Sedenions are
   concerned (except, whatever it is, no one's discovered it is yet!).

   1994), p. 242.
7 The clearest exposition I've found of this "unobservability principle" - which the authors actually relate to St. Augus-
   tine's views on the origins of Space and Time! - is contained in the string-theoretic (but not yet M-theory aware) text by
   Q. Ho-Kim, N. Kumar, and C. S. Lam, Invitation to Contemporary Physics (World Scientific: River Edge NJ, 1991),
   442-446. (Their discussion also indicates why 1-D "strings" - but not yet why "p-branes," p > 1 - in the first place!)

   177:1 (1967), 70-71 (Russian); English translation in Sov. Phys. Dokl. 11:3 (1968), 381.
9 Agnes Arber, The Mind and the Eye (Cambridge U.P.: Cambridge UK, 1964), 41: "Every grade can be traced between
   remote analogies, and analogies which are so close that they pass into identities, and - paradoxically enough - it is often
   the remote analogies which have the greatest value, while it is the close analogies of which we have to beware. The
   misuse of an analogy by pressing it to the point at which it is confused with an identity, is one to which biological
   thought is peculiarly liable." Where Ms. Arber says "biological," though, we can just as well speak of any heavily
   qualitative and/or speculative area of science (viz., cosmology) where metrics are hard to come by.

11 For completeness, I list in the "Strut Table"'s second column a set of indices I call "Goto numbers" in BK1, 4 per Box-
   Kite (and 1 per Sail). These refer to the 7 "deformed" Octonion copies the Sedenions contain, which I variously called
   "Moreno counterfeits" and "automorphemes" (the latter being a name only someone overly fond of L<U+00E9>vi-Strauss's struc-
   turalism could love). It was these which, by other means, Cawagas showed corresponded to instances of a hitherto unre-
   cognized variety of ZD-harboring "loop." Each of these 7 loops contains 4 "Co-Assessor trio" 6-cycles, each of which
   appears in exactly one Box-Kite as a "Sail." (Making a "remote analogy," think of a Box-Kite, then, as a tetrad of
   parental chromosomes, with the "Zigzag" as the father's "Y" and the "Trefoils" as the 3 "X's.")

# Inverse Cayley-Dickson Formalism

Extracted from conversation logs (convos/1_read_each_nonuser_line.md,
convos/3_further_explorations.md). Content generated by ChatGPT "Advanced
Mathematics" custom GPT in conversation with the user. Mathematical claims
below are UNVERIFIED unless explicitly noted.

## 1. Formal Inverse CD Process

### 1.1 Classical CD Baseline

Standard doubling: A_{2^n} = A_{2^{n-1}} (+) A_{2^{n-1}} with

    (a,b)(c,d) = (ac - d*b, da + bc*)
    (a,b)* = (a*, -b)

Quadratic form N(a,b) = aa* + bb* is multiplicative only through n=3
(octonions), by Hurwitz's theorem.

### 1.2 Inverse Recursion (Informal)

    A_{n-1} = (1/2) A_n,    A_n = A_{2^n}

Flow diagram: ... -> (1/8)A_8 -> (1/4)A_4 -> (1/2)A_2 -> A_1

### 1.3 Homotopy Limit Formulation

Formalized as a homotopy limit in a derived category:

    A~ = holim_{k -> infinity} (1/2^k) A_{2^{n+k}}

Convergence conditions: filtered colimit presentations, spectral sequence
stabilization (Adams or Atiyah-Hirzebruch). References cited: Weibel
(Homological Algebra), Lurie (Higher Algebra).

### 1.4 Pre-Cayley-Dickson Retract

Let A_n be the 2^n-dimensional CD algebra. Define:

    rho_n : A_{n+1} -> A_n,  rho_n(a,b) = a  (forgetful retraction)

Parametric product on A_n:

    a o_theta c := pi_{A_n}( (a,0) *_{CD,theta} (c,0) ),  theta in {+/-1}

Lemma (Closure): (A_n, o_theta) is closed since (a,0)(c,0) = (ac, 0).

### 1.5 Inverse Conjugation Operator

    C^{-1}(a,b) = (a, b*)  where ||b*||^2 = -||b||^2
    C^{-1}(C^{-1}(a,b)) = (a, -b)

### 1.6 Inverse Multiplication

    (a,b) o (c,d) = (ac + Psi(b,d), F(a,d,b,c))

where Psi depends on context:
- p-Adic: Psi(b,d) = bd mod p
- Surreal: Psi(b,d) = (b+d)/2
- Negative-D: Psi(b,d) = -bd (inverse reflection)

## 2. Dimensional Degradation Ladder

### Classical (verified)

| n | Algebra     | dim | Property Lost              |
|---|-------------|-----|----------------------------|
| 0 | R (Reals)   | 1   | (none)                     |
| 1 | C (Complex) | 2   | Ordering                   |
| 2 | H (Quat.)   | 4   | Commutativity              |
| 3 | O (Oct.)    | 8   | Associativity              |
| 4 | S (Sed.)    | 16  | Alternative, normed div.   |
| 5+| Higher      | 32+ | Further degradation        |

### Inverse Process (speculative)

Reverse dimensionality: D(X_{n+1}) = D(X_n) / 2

| Step | System              | D     |
|------|---------------------|-------|
| 1    | R (Reals)           | 1     |
| 2    | D (Dyadic)          | 1/2   |
| 3    | Q_p (p-Adics)       | 1/4   |
| 4    | No (Surreals)       | 1/8   |
| 5    | F_p (Finite Fields) | 0     |
| 6    | Q_{-p} (Neg p-Adic) | -1/4  |
| 7    | No^{-1} (Neg Surr.) | -1/8  |

## 3. Categorical Treatment

### A-infinity Structure

Maps m_n : A^{tensor n} -> A satisfying higher coherence conditions.

First nontrivial homotopy:

    m_3(a, b, c) = epsilon * (abc - a(bc))

### A-infinity Functor to Exceptional Lie Algebras

    F : SNAF(D) -> E_8

Lie bracket error bound: ||[F(T_x), F(T_y)] - F(T(x*y))|| = O(10^{-5})

This is from a toy model computation, NOT a rigorous proof. The error bound
arises from H^3(SNAF, R) != 0 with dim(H^3) ~ 10^5.

### Negative Categories

    Cat_{-n} = Hom(Cat_n, Cat_{-n})

with morphism reversal: Hom_{C^{-1}}(X,Y) = Hom_C(Y,X).

## 4. Fractional and Negative Dimensions

### Continuous Dimension

    dim(A_x) = 2^x,   d/dx dim(A_x) = ln(2) * dim(A_x)

### K-Theoretic Interpretation

    dim(A_n) = sum_{i=0}^{infty} (-1)^i rank(K_i(A_n))

Via Bott periodicity: dim(A_n) = -dim(A_{n-1}).

### Corrected Framing (from audit)

"Negative-dimensional" actions are formally:
- Analytically continued actions S(d) with d in C (dimensional regularization)
- Fractional generators on R^n with n fixed and d encoded in kinetic operator

This replaces informal "negative-dimensional action" with standard objects.

## 5. Open Problems

1. Convergence of homotopy limit (A_infinity-coalgebra model?)
2. Spectral triple verification (Hausdorff vs spectral dimension)
3. Exact functoriality (strict functor vs inherent A_infinity relaxation)
4. p-Adic deformations and gauge representation theory
5. Pre-CD algebraics: classify when o_theta is isotopic to native product

## Critical Assessment

- "Negative-dimensional division algebras" are NOT a standard notion.
  Hurwitz constrains real normed division algebras to R, C, H, O.
- Negative homotopy groups pi_{-n}(X) live in spectra (stable homotopy),
  not ordinary topological spaces.
- "Negative dimension" in physics is analytic continuation or
  effective/spectral (CDT), not literal geometry.
- The error bound O(10^{-5}) and Dixmier trace values are from toy models.
- The entire framework is SPECULATIVE and not peer-reviewed.

# Reggiani 2024 manifold identifications (C-005)

Access date: 2026-01-28

Scope: this file records what is asserted in Reggiani (arXiv:2411.18881) about
manifold identifications for sedenion zero-divisor sets. The repo does not
replicate the Riemannian geometry/isometry proofs; it only aligns definitions
and validates algebraic invariants.

- URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18881

## Key claims (paper-asserted)

The paper states (paraphrase, see PDF for full proofs):

1) Z(S) is (homeomorphic / diffeomorphic) to G2, and the induced metric makes it
   isometric to G2 with a particular left-invariant metric.

2) ZD(S) is isometric to the Stiefel manifold V2(R7) (also presented as G2/SU(2))
   with a specific G2-invariant metric family.

## 2. Verified Results

### ZD(S) isometric to V_2(R^7) [Reggiani 2024]

    ZD(S) = { u in S : ||u||^2 = 2, exists v with uv = 0 }

ZD(S) is isometric (not just homeomorphic) to the Stiefel manifold
V_2(R^7), equivalently G_2 / SU(2), with a specific G_2-invariant metric.

Dimension: dim V_2(R^7) = 7*2 - 2*3/2 = 11
Codimension in S^15: 15 - 11 = 4 (matches annihilator dimension)

### Z(S) homeomorphic to G_2 [Moreno 1998]

    Z(S) = { (u,v) in S x S : ||u|| = ||v|| = sqrt(2), uv = 0 }

| Set   | Elements       | dim | Topology   |
|-------|----------------|-----|------------|
| Z(S)  | Pairs (u,v)    | 14  | G_2        |
| ZD(S) | Single u       | 11  | V_2(R^7)   |

The SU(2) fiber (dim 3) accounts for the 14 - 11 = 3 difference.

## 3. Computational Verification (in codebase)

| Z(S) ~ G_2 homeomorphism       | --               | NOT REPLICATED |

### Discrepancy: 5 vs 6 distinct distances

Rust computation finds 5 distinct geodesic distance values among 42
same-sign subspaces; Reggiani claims 6. Possible causes: convention
differences, tolerance binning, or sign-variant interpretation correction.

### Sign-variant correction

Early Python analysis (2026-01-30): 42 distinct subspaces (sign variants
share subspaces). Later Rust analysis (2026-02-06): sign variants have
ORTHOGONAL annihilators (distance = pi in Gr(4,16)). The Rust result
(84 distinct subspaces) supersedes.

### Box-kite stratification (novel finding)

Within same box-kite: mean Grassmannian distance = 2.7735
Across box-kites: mean distance = 2.2092
Delta = 0.5643 (counterintuitive: within > across)

# Wheel Algebra Taxonomy

Extracted from conversation logs (convos/2_exploration_cont.md,
convos/1_read_nonuser_lines_cont.md). Content generated by ChatGPT in
conversation with the user. Mathematical claims are UNVERIFIED.

## IMPORTANT: Naming Collision

The conversation uses "wheel algebra" to denote a family of NON-ASSOCIATIVE,
NON-COMMUTATIVE algebras with cyclic multiplication structure. This is
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT from the Carlstrom/Setzer "wheel" that totalizes
division (implemented in crates/algebra_core/src/wheels.rs as WheelQ).

The two concepts share only a name. Do not conflate them.

## 1. Conversation's W_n Definition

A "Wheel Algebra" W_n of dimension n over field F:

    W_n = span_F {e_1, e_2, ..., e_n}
    e_i * e_j = sum_k omega_{ijk} e_k

Subject to:
- Non-associativity: (e_i * e_j) * e_k != e_i * (e_j * e_k) for some triples
- Cyclic multiplication: e_i * e_{i+1} = omega_i * e_{i+2}
- Structure constant antisymmetry: omega_{ijk} = -omega_{jik}

## 2. Taxonomy of Types

### 2A. Clifford-Wheel Algebras

    e_i e_j + e_j e_i = g_{ij} e_k

where g_{ij} is a metric with cyclic constraints. For W_3:

    e_1 e_2 = e_3,  e_2 e_3 = e_1,  e_3 e_1 = e_2

(Isomorphic to Z/3Z action on basis elements.)

### 2B. Octonionic Wheel Algebras (W_8)

Extends octonions with cyclic transformation T:

    T(e_i e_j) = e_{i (+) j}  (addition mod 8)

### 2C. Sedenionic Wheel Algebras (W_16, W_32)

Extensions to sedenions and beyond, relaxing norm composition while
maintaining cyclic symmetry.

### 2D. Lattice-Embedded Wheel Algebras

    e_i e_j = e_k + lambda * e_m

where lambda depends on lattice structure (E8, Leech, Coxeter):

    e_i e_j = sum_{k in Gamma} C_{ijk} e_k

### 2E. Twisted Wheel Algebras

    [e_i, e_j]_theta = e_k + theta * e_m

with twisting parameter theta governing algebraic phase shifts.

### 2F. Fractal Wheel Algebras

Recursive self-similar: W_n embeds fractally into W_{2n}.

### 2G. Surreal-Negative Wheel Algebras (SNAWAs)

Category SNAW with functor F: SNAW -> E (exceptional Lie groups).
STATUS: UNPROVEN. Acknowledged as speculative in conversation's own audit.

## 3. Exotic Integer Ring Families

These are STANDARD mathematics (well-defined, well-known):

### Gaussian Integers Z[i]
    Z[i] = {a + bi | a,b in Z},  i^2 = -1
    Norm: N(a+bi) = a^2 + b^2
    Unique factorization holds.

### Eisenstein Integers Z[omega]
    Z[omega] = {a + b*omega | a,b in Z}
    omega = e^{2*pi*i/3} = (-1 + sqrt(-3))/2
    Norm: N(a+b*omega) = a^2 - ab + b^2

### Hurwitz Integers
    H = {a + bi + cj + dk | a,b,c,d in Z or (1/2)Z}
    (includes half-integer components, unlike Lipschitz integers)

### Octavian Integers
    O = {a_0 + a_1*e_1 + ... + a_7*e_7 | a_i in Z or (1/2)Z}

## 4. What is NOT in the Codebase

Compared to the existing WheelQ (Carlstrom wheel of rationals):

1. W_n cyclic wheel algebras -- NOT implemented
2. Clifford-Wheel algebras -- NOT implemented
3. Lattice-Embedded wheel algebras -- NOT implemented
4. Twisted/exotic wheel algebras -- NOT implemented
5. Fractal recursive constructions -- NOT implemented
6. SNAWAs -- NOT implemented
7. Eisenstein integers Z[omega] -- NOT implemented
8. Octavian integers -- NOT implemented
9. Hurwitz integers -- NOT implemented (CD elements exist but not the
   integer sublattice)
10. Structure constant tensor omega_{ijk} -- NOT implemented

## 5. Critical Assessment

- The W_n "cyclic wheel algebras" have genuine mathematical content
  (cyclic permutation matrices, structure constants) but the connection
  to Carlstrom wheels is purely nominal.
- SNAWA definitions are speculative with no rigorous construction given.
- The exotic integer families (Gaussian, Eisenstein, Hurwitz, Octavian)
  are well-established standard mathematics.
- Computational "validations" in the conversations use random matrices,
  not actual algebraic structure constants.
