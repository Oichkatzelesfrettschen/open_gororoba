# TODO (updated 2026-02-13): executable, test-driven tracker

Primary trackers:
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` (consolidated roadmap: architecture, crates, migration history)
- `registry/roadmap.toml` (authoritative roadmap registry)
- `registry/todo.toml` (authoritative, schema-hardened)
- `registry/next_actions.toml` (priority queue, schema-hardened)
- `docs/NEXT_ACTIONS.md` (generated mirror)

Note:
- Python-to-Rust migration is COMPLETE (all 15 modules ported, gororoba_kernels removed).
- Four Theses pipeline COMPLETE (Phase 1-4, Sprint 28-40).
- 3442 Rust tests (unit + integration + doc) pass, 0 clippy warnings.
- Claims: C-001..C-674 (674 total, enriched). Insights: I-001..I-066.
- Experiments: E-001..E-033 (31 total). Binaries: 66.
- All governance gates pass (governance-gate, schema signatures, ASCII-only).

## Current sprint: Sprint 41 -- Phase 5 Publication Preparation (PLANNED)

- [ ] T-014: LaTeX scaffold (docs/latex/llm_scaffold_paper.tex, make latex)
- [ ] T-015: Anti-Diagonal Parity Theorem paper section (I-018 exposition)
- [ ] T-016: Synthesis engine results tables (auto-generated from TOML evidence)
- [ ] T-017: Reproducibility appendix (exact commands, checksums, hardware specs)
- [ ] T-018: Optional 128^3 GPU grid validation (lbm_3d_cuda)

## Previous sprint: Sprint 40 -- Phase 3-4 Synthesis (COMPLETE)

- [x] Burn neural correction tensor training (MLP 256->128->64->16, Adam, MSE)
- [x] Pentagon violation reduced 78% (2.50 -> 0.547)
- [x] E-029 three-way evidence: neural, algebraic-only, perturbed
- [x] Synthesis engine: T3 pipeline with neural stream
- [x] All 4 theses pass simultaneously (T1 r=-1.0, T2 1.254, T3 78%, T4 R2=0.995)
- [x] Claims consolidation pipeline: normalize, enrich, crosslink, merge, resolve
- [x] 1697 fields enriched, 2606 cross-links, 10 merges, 66 conflicts resolved
- [x] C-671..C-674, I-066, E-029/E-033. 3442 tests.

## Previous sprint: Sprint 27 -- Algebra Family Census (COMPLETE)

- [x] Quaternion/octonion/sedenion family census across construction methods
- [x] Non-commutativity universal at dim>=4 (all gamma signatures)
- [x] Zero-divisor count gamma-dependent (parametric property)
- [x] C-550..C-556, I-020..I-024

## Completed (keep for provenance)
- [x] Sprint 40: Phase 3-4 synthesis (neural + engine). 3442 tests.
- [x] Sprint 27: Algebra family census. C-550..C-556.
- [x] Sprint 26: dim=512 APT, psi/eta tower, split-CD. C-531..C-549.
- [x] Sprint 25: Anti-Diagonal Parity Theorem mechanism. C-495..C-527, I-018. 2312 tests.
- [x] Sprint 21-24: Face sign census (dim=16..256), Double 3:1 Law.
- [x] Sprint 16-20: Rho(b) REFUTED, twist-delta RESOLVED, experiments E-011..E-013.
- [x] Sprint 13-15: Monograph layers 0-5, terminology, glossary.
- [x] Sprint 10-12: Emanation L1-L18, registry integrity, HDF5, LaTeX.
- [x] Sprint 8-9: Lattice codebook, dip test, CdMultTable.
- [x] Sprint 1-7: Python migration, GR port, GPU ultrametric, claims infrastructure.
