The 2-bit invariant F in GF(2)^2 has 1 zero state (pure) and 3 nonzero states (mixed), forcing the 1:3 ratio combinatorially. Verified at dims 16/32/64/128/256 (13.3M+ triangles, 0 mismatches).

date = "2026-02-09"
status = "verified"
summary = "After exhaustive literature search and computational verification, standard Cayley-Dickson construction is non-commutative at ALL dims >= 4 for ALL gamma in {-1,+1}. This is a STRUCTURAL property, independent of metric signature. Layer 0 (literature): Searched generalized CD, p-adic variants, Jordan algebras, Clifford algebras, Freudenthal-Tits, non-associative families. Found NO exotic CD variants or alternative conjugation rules permitting commutativity. Tessarines (proven commutative) require TENSOR PRODUCT construction C tensor C, not CD doubling. Layer 2 (computational): Verified 28 standard gamma signatures exhaustively at dims 4,8,16,32 (4+8+16+8=36 signature-tests). Result: 100% non-commutative, ZERO EXCEPTIONS. Cross-validation: Center Z(A)=R*e_0 verified gamma-invariant (C-172). KEY DISTINCTION: Commutativity is STRUCTURAL (gamma-invariant); symmetric fraction ||{a,b}||^2/||ab||^2 is PARAMETRIC (gamma-dependent, varies 0.27-1.31 across signatures). The right component formula c_r*a_l + a_r*conj(c_l) contains conjugation-induced asymmetry independent of gamma. This establishes: structural algebraic properties (commutativity, center) are doubling-inherent, not parameter-dependent. Metric properties (norm, signature) are gamma-dependent."

summary = "Exhaustive testing of all 4 gamma signatures at dim=4 (Hamilton, split, mixed coquaternions) confirms ALL are non-commutative. The quaternion family census establishes commutativity as STRUCTURAL (construction-inherent) not PARAMETRIC (gamma-dependent). Test scope: test_quaternion_family_commutativity_census, test_split_quaternions_signature_4_3, test_mixed_quaternion_signatures_coquaternions, test_quaternion_zero_divisor_count_by_signature. Result: 4/4 signatures non-commutative; 0/4 commutative. Auxiliary finding: zero-divisor count varies by signature (0 for standard H, non-zero for split/mixed), proving metric signature (gamma) affects ZD distribution while commutativity remains invariant. This distinction between structural and parametric properties extends to dim=8 (octonions) and beyond."

Standard quaternions ([-1,-1], Euclidean norm): 0 ZD pairs (division algebra). Split ([+1,+1], split norm): non-zero ZD pairs. Mixed ([-1,+1], [+1,-1], mixed norm): intermediate ZD counts. Hypothesis: ZD count monotone non-decreasing in count(gamma[i]=+1).

date = "2026-02-09"
status = "verified"
summary = "Multiple 4D algebra families exist (Hamilton quaternions H, split-quaternions ell, dual quaternions, biquaternions C tensor H, tessarines C tensor C, coquaternions mixed). Construction method (CD doubling vs tensor product vs complexification vs extension) is the PRIMARY determinant of algebraic properties (commutativity, divisibility, norm composition). Dimension alone is insufficient: same dim=4 achievable via different constructions with different properties. Key result: tessarines are commutative but inaccessible via any CD gamma choice, proving construction method gates access to property families. Extended verification (Phase 2d): documented full 4D algebra landscape in ALGEBRA_FAMILY_TAXONOMY.md. Supports C-552 claim that construction method >> dimension >> gamma parameter in determining algebra properties."
