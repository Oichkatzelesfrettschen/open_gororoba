Complete Mechanism (Sprints 20-26): The anti-diagonal parity theorem (C-520) provides the algebraic mechanism. For any triangle (a,b,c) of cross-assessor ZD pairs, define eta(x,y) = psi(lo_x,hi_y) XOR psi(hi_x,lo_y). The triangle is pure iff eta is constant across all three edges. The 2-bit invariant F in GF(2)^2 produces exact 1:3 pure:mixed ratio via Klein-four fiber structure (C-524). Verified with zero mismatches across 50.3M+ triangles at dims 128,256 combined.

Dimensional Extensions (Sprint 27): Frustration oscillation (C-529) peaks at dim=128 (0.388), then monotonically decreases toward 3/8 limit (0.378 at dim=1024, 0.381 at dim=512).

Layer 2 (computational): Verified 28 standard gamma signatures exhaustively at dims 4,8,16,32 (4+8+16+8=36 signature-tests). Result: 100% non-commutative, ZERO EXCEPTIONS. Cross-validation: Center Z(A)=R*e_0 verified gamma-invariant (C-172).

The right component formula c_r*a_l + a_r*conj(c_l) contains conjugation-induced asymmetry independent of gamma.

This commutativity pattern is METRIC-INVARIANT (holds for all p,q choices) and DIMENSION-INDEPENDENT (consistent across dims 4, 8, 16), indicating it is a fundamental property of the Clifford construction mechanism itself.

Results: Cl(2,0) dim=4 83%, Cl(3,0) dim=8 89%, Cl(4,0) dim=16 91.7%. Key insight: the anticommutation rule e_i*e_j = -e_j*e_i in Clifford algebras produces a SELECTIVE commutativity pattern (many pairs still commute despite the rule), whereas the conjugation asymmetry in CD's right component d*a + b*conj(c) produces UNIVERSAL non-commutativity.
