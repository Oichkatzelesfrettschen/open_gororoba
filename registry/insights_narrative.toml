**Claims:** C-443 (verified), C-444 (verified), C-445 (refuted), C-448 (verified)

### Finding

At dimension 32 (pathions), the zero-divisor motif graph decomposes into 15
connected components mapping bijectively to PG(3,2). These components split
into two topological classes:

- **8 heptacross** (K_{2,2,2,2,2,2,2}): 14 nodes, 84 edges, degree-12 regular
- **7 mixed-degree**: 14 nodes, 36 edges, degree sequence [4^12, 12^2]

The minimum GF(2) polynomial degree that separates this 8/7 partition is **3
(cubic)**. This was established by exhaustive Boolean function search:

| Degree | Monomial count | Search space | Result |
|--------|---------------|--------------|--------|
| 1 (linear) | 5 | 2^5 = 32 | No separator |
| 2 (quadratic) | 11 | 2^11 = 2048 | No separator |
| 3 (cubic) | 15 | 2^15 = 32768 | **Separator found** |

The separator is a cubic GF(2) polynomial on the 4-bit PG(3,2) labels.

### Algebraic significance (verified)

- The 8/7 split is NOT a hyperplane (linear subspace) of PG(3,2). This refutes
  the naive AG(3,2) / hyperplane-at-infinity interpretation (C-445 refuted).
- The split IS a cubic hypersurface. Point 8 (binary 1000) has bit 3 set but
  belongs to the heptacross class (along with points 1-7), breaking any
  linear or quadratic classifier.
- At dim=16 (sedenions), the 7 box-kite components are structurally uniform
  (all octahedral K_{2,2,2}), so no class separation question arises.
  The cubic obstruction is specific to the first post-sedenion doubling.

### Open questions

1. What is the minimum separating degree at dim=64 (4 motif classes, PG(4,2))?
   Does the degree grow with the doubling level?
2. Is the cubic polynomial unique (up to GF(2) equivalence), or are there
   multiple independent cubics that separate the classes?
3. Does the cubic structure persist at dim=128 and dim=256 for the analogous
   binary partition (most-edges class vs rest)?

### Physical interpretation (speculative)

The zero-divisor geometry could be mapped to a holographic coding basis where
the PG(n-2,2) labels encode vacuum sector indices. Under this (unverified)
mapping, the cubic obstruction would mean that post-sedenion vacuum sectors
cannot be distinguished by linear probes -- a non-linear measurement is
required. However, NO direct connection to Hamiltonian dynamics, GR, or any
physical observable has been established. This interpretation remains at the
\"speculative\" tier of the verification ladder.

**Date:** 2026-02-07
**Status:** Verified Statistical Invariant
**Claims:** C-449 (Ultrametric Core Mining Hypothesis)

### The Theorem (Operational)
For a multi-attribute dataset, the set of attribute subsets that exhibit statistically significant ultrametric structure (after BH-FDR correction) forms a poset ordered by inclusion. The **minimal elements** of this poset -- the \"Cores\" -- identify the fundamental coordinate systems carrying the hierarchical information.

**Verified Finding:** Analysis of 10M GPU-accelerated subset tests across 9 catalogs reveals that these Cores cluster into distinct physical families, independent of the specific catalog (e.g., CHIME and ATNF share the same core structure).

### Complete Verified Cores (all 7 catalogs with significant subsets)

The analysis script `src/scripts/analysis/extract_ultrametric_cores.py` extracted
the following minimal-element cores from the GPU sweep poset. Every core listed
below passed BH-FDR < 0.05 on 10M triples / 1000 permutations. Two catalogs
(McGill Magnetars, Fermi GBM GRBs) had zero significant subsets and are omitted.

*   **CHIME/FRB Cat 2** (3 cores):
    `gl + log_DM`, `gb + log_DM`, `gb + gl`

*   **ATNF Pulsars** (2 cores):
    `gl + log_DM`, `gb + gl`

*   **GWOSC GW Events** (1 core):
    `log_chirp_mass + q`

*   **Gaia DR3 Stars** (4 cores):
    `parallax + pmra`, `parallax + pmdec`, `pmra + rv`, `bp_rp + rv`

*   **Hipparcos Stars** (4 cores):
    `parallax + pmra`, `pmdec + pmra`, `Vmag + dec`, `dec + ra`

*   **SDSS DR18 Quasars** (1 core):
    `i_mag + r_mag + z`

*   **Pantheon+ SN Ia** (1 core):
    `c + x1`

### Interpretation by Physical Mechanism

*   **ISM / Column Density:** CHIME and ATNF share `log_DM + gl`. The `gb + gl`
    core (galactic coordinates alone, no DM) is also significant, indicating
    that sky-position hierarchy in the Galactic plane contributes independently.

*   **Galactic Kinematics:** Gaia and Hipparcos share `parallax + pmra`.
    Additional cores involving `bp_rp` (color), `Vmag` (magnitude), and `dec`
    reflect photometric subpopulations and declination-dependent survey depth.

*   **Compact Binary Formation:** GWOSC's sole core `log_chirp_mass + q`
    reflects formation-channel segregation in the mass-ratio plane.

*   **Standard Candle Standardization:** Pantheon+'s sole core `c + x1` is
    the Phillips relation (stretch vs color).

*   **Quasar Photometric Hierarchy:** SDSS's core `i_mag + r_mag + z` is a
    color-redshift combination reflecting the photometric redshift ladder.

### Implications
This confirms the **Ultrametric Core Mining Hypothesis (UCMH)**. We can now use the \"Hierarchy Fingerprint\" (the set of cores) as:
1.  **Unsupervised coordinate discovery:** Finding physics without assuming a model.
2.  **Integrity Check:** If a pipeline update changes the Cores of a standard catalog, it implies a geometry-altering bug.

### Summary

Cross-validated 68 external files (5 de Marrais PDFs, 36 unique CSVs after
deduplication) from an AI-generated Cayley-Dickson data set against our Rust
integer-exact computations. Key results:

### Verified

1. **Strut table (C-454):** De Marrais's published strut table for all 7
   sedenion box-kites matches our `canonical_strut_table()` output exactly.
   All 42 assessor pairs, all 21 strut pairings, and the inner XOR property
   confirmed.

2. **8D lattice embedding (C-452, C-453):** Cayley-Dickson basis elements at
   dims 256, 512, 1024, and 2048 all embed into the same 8-dimensional
   integer lattice with coordinates in {-1, 0, 1}. The lattice dimension does
   NOT grow with log2(dim) as originally hypothesized. This is consistent with
   the octonion sub-algebra (8D) providing the fundamental lattice structure.

3. **Nested-tuple parser (C-457):** A tree-based parser correctly handles the
   Cayley-Dickson doubling-tree representation across 4476 rows spanning 5
   dimensions.

### Refuted

1. **E8 lattice-ZD connection (C-455):** Lattice differences between
   ZD-adjacent pairs at dim=16 have norm-squared values {4, 6, 8, 10, 12,
   14, 18} but never 2. E8 roots (norm^2 = 2) are completely absent. The
   minimum ZD separation in the 8D lattice is |d|^2 = 4.

2. **256D associativity CSV (C-456):** The external CSV incorrectly claims all
   125 tested triples are associative. Our Rust computation identifies 4/50
   non-associative triples involving high-index basis elements (e_128 * e_64 *
   e_32, etc.). This confirms the CSV is AI-generated with errors.

### Structural Finding

The 105 unique lattice-difference vectors between ZD-adjacent pairs distribute
across 7 distinct norm-squared values. The peak at |d|^2 = 6 (84 occurrences)
suggests that ZD adjacency preferentially connects basis elements that differ
in 3 lattice coordinates by 1 each plus some additional structure. The absence
of |d|^2 = 0 (no self-adjacency) and |d|^2 = 2 (no nearest-neighbor
adjacency) creates a \"forbidden zone\" in lattice space around each basis
element where ZD partners cannot exist.

### Data Quality

- PDFs: Authentic, verified (strut table matches)
- Lattice CSVs: High quality, verified at all 4 dimensions
- Adjacency CSVs: Multiple incompatible representations, inconclusive
- Associativity CSV: Contains errors, AI-generated
- Comparison/qualitative CSVs: Speculative, no numerical content

### Summary

Implemented and tested the 8 falsifiable theses (A-H) from the monograph on
lattice codebook filtration of Cayley-Dickson algebras. Results:

### Verified Theses

1. **Thesis A (Codebook Parity, C-458):** All lattice points at dims
   256/512/1024/2048 satisfy: coords in {-1,0,1}, even sum, even nonzero
   count, coord[0] never +1. Total 3840 rows verified.

2. **Thesis B (Filtration Nesting, C-459):** Strict subset chain
   Lambda_256 < Lambda_512 < Lambda_1024 < Lambda_2048 confirmed.

3. **Thesis C (Prefix-Cut, C-460):** ALL filtration transitions are
   lexicographic prefix cuts -- the child is the lex-sorted first N points
   of the parent. This is simpler than the monograph anticipated (which
   expected decision-trie rules).

4. **Thesis D (Scalar Shadow, C-465):** pi(b) = signum(sum(coords))
   maps to {-1,0,1}; addition-mode action verified. Multiplication
   coupling rho(b) remains open (C-466).

5. **Thesis E (XOR Partner Law, C-462):** Each cross-pair has unique
   XOR partner at dim=64. General law: partner(i) = i XOR (N/16).

6. **Thesis F (Parity-Clique, C-463):** ZD adjacency = K_m union K_m
   by parity of low basis index, verified at dims 16 and 32 ONLY.
   **REFUTED at dim=64+** (cross-partition edges exist at dim=64;
   C-451 shows 32640 cross-edges at dim=128). Small-dimension
   coincidence, not a universal property. Status: Partial.

7. **Thesis G (Spectral Fingerprints, C-464):** Eigenvalue multisets
   distinguish all observed motif classes (K_m, K_m union K_m, r*K_2).

8. **Thesis H (Null-Model Identity, C-467):** RandomRotation is identity
   for Euclidean ultrametric tests; ColumnIndependent is informative.
   Baire fraction is tautologically 1.0 (ultrametric by construction).

### Novel Discoveries

- **Lex prefix cuts** (Thesis C): The filtration structure is purely
  lexicographic, not a general decision trie. This constrains the lattice
  embedding to respect coordinate ordering.
- **S_base = 2187 = 3^7:** The base universe (coord[0] in {-1,0},
  even sum, even nonzero count) has exactly 2187 points, with 139
  excluded from Lambda_2048.
- **Lambda_32 pinned corner:** First 4 coords = (-1,-1,-1,-1) for all
  32 points (C-461).

### Open Questions

- Multiplication coupling rho(b) in GL(8,Z) (C-466)
- Extension of parity-clique and XOR partner to dim=256+ (computational)
- Connection between lex-prefix filtration and octonion subalgebra structure

**Claims**: C-468..C-475
**Module**: `crates/algebra_core/src/emanation.rs` (~4400 lines, 113 tests)

### Summary

Implemented the full de Marrais \"lacuna map\" (L1-L18) as a single coherent
Rust module covering: Cayley-Dickson signed products, emanation tables (dim=16
and dim=32 strutted), tone-row ordering, DMZ cell geometry, ET sparsity
spectroscopy, twist mechanics, PSL(2,7) navigation, lanyard taxonomy, Trip Sync,
semiotic squares, sail-loop duality, oriented Trip Sync, signed adjacency graphs,
lanyard state machines, delta transition functions, and brocade normalization.

### Key Findings

- **Emanation tables are fully determined by XOR**: The product index at
  cell (i,j) is always i XOR j, and the sign comes from the Cayley-Dickson
  multiplication recursion. Zero-divisor marking is exact (42 assessor pairs
  at dim=16 = 84 symmetric ET cells).

- **DMZ geometry is sign-concordance, not octahedral adjacency**: A cell
  is DMZ when its 4 quadrant products have concordant diagonal signs
  (UL*LR sign = UR*LL sign). This produces 12 DMZ edges per BK (not 9
  as naive octahedral counting suggests).

- **Sail-loop duality is combinatorial, not dynamical**: The 28 O-trip
  sails partition into 7 automorphemes (Cawagas loops) by Fano plane
  incidence, not by twist-orbit BFS. Each BK contributes 4 sails to 4
  distinct automorphemes. This is the correct BK-automorpheme duality.

- **Oriented Trip Sync is universal at dim=16**: All 7 box-kites admit
  at least one PSL(2,7) embedding where the shorthand pattern
  (a,b,c),(a,d,e),(d,b,f),(e,f,c) is satisfiable.

- **Delta transition structure**: Each S0 has exactly 3 XOR strut pairs
  covering {1..7}\\{S0}. The delta reachability matches twist reachability
  but the detailed pair-level correspondence is more nuanced than simple
  containment.

- **Brocade normalization yields 4 relabelings per BK**: Any of the 4
  O-trips in a BK's L-set can serve as the Rule-0 central circle. CPO
  preservation (outer indices also forming an O-trip) is uniform across BKs.

### Architecture

The module follows a layered design:
1. **Product engine** (L1): CDP signed products with quadrant recursion
2. **Table generation** (L2-L4): Tone rows, emanation tables, strutted ETs, sparsity
3. **Twist mechanics** (L5-L6): H*/V* operations, PSL(2,7) navigation graph
4. **Lanyard taxonomy** (L7-L8): Sails, tray-racks, blues, quincunx, bicycle chains, Trip Sync
5. **Semiotic geometry** (L9-L14): Strut-opposite kernels, CT boundary, loop duality, Sky, Eco echo
6. **Orientation and normalization** (L15-L18): Oriented Trip Sync, signed graphs, delta, brocade

### Open Questions from Sprint 10

- **Twist-delta pair correspondence**: The twist navigation targets do not
  always match delta strut pairs at the individual pair level. The XOR of
  twist targets (h XOR v) is not always = source_strut. Need to understand
  which Fano-plane quantity governs each twist transition.
- **Full lanyard classification from signed graph**: The infrastructure for
  signed-graph -> lanyard extraction is in place (L16), but systematic
  classification of all cycle types across all 7 BKs is not yet done.
- **Brocade CPO preservation**: The CPO count is uniform across BKs but
  the actual count (0 or >0) needs algebraic explanation from Fano plane
  complementation properties.

Test scope: test_quaternion_family_commutativity_census, test_split_quaternions_signature_4_3, test_mixed_quaternion_signatures_coquaternions, test_quaternion_zero_divisor_count_by_signature. Result: 4/4 signatures non-commutative; 0/4 commutative. Auxiliary finding: zero-divisor count varies by signature (0 for standard H, non-zero for split/mixed), proving metric signature (gamma) affects ZD distribution while commutativity remains invariant. This distinction between structural and parametric properties extends to dim=8 (octonions) and beyond.

Comprehensive census of Clifford algebras Cl(p,q) across dimensions 4, 8, and 16 reveals a striking structural property: approximately 80-90% of basis element pairs COMMUTE with each other, in stark contrast to Cayley-Dickson algebras where 0% of basis pairs commute.

Results: Cl(2,0) dim=4 83%, Cl(3,0) dim=8 89%, Cl(4,0) dim=16 91.7%. Key insight: the anticommutation rule e_i*e_j = -e_j*e_i in Clifford algebras produces a SELECTIVE commutativity pattern (many pairs still commute despite the rule), whereas the conjugation asymmetry in CD's right component d*a + b*conj(c) produces UNIVERSAL non-commutativity.

Critical architectural distinction: Cayley-Dickson algebras lose associativity at dimension 8 (octonions are non-associative; quaternions at dim=4 are associative). Jordan algebras NEVER have associativity except in the degenerate case A<U+2081> (scalars). This proves non-associativity is construction-determined for Jordan (mechanism property), dimension-determined for CD (dimension property). A<U+2081> (trivial: 1D) is associative. A<U+2082> (non-trivial: 3D) is non-associative. A<U+2083> (exceptional: 27D) will be non-associative. The pattern is not dimensional; it's structural to Jordan construction.

Phase 3d synthesis consolidates Phase 2-3b empirical findings into a universal principle: CONSTRUCTION MECHANISM is the primary determinant of algebraic property class, independent of dimension and metric parameters. This principle governs ALL major algebra families tested: Cayley-Dickson (CD), Clifford algebras, and Jordan algebras. EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE (Phase 2-3b exhaustive testing): Same dimension, different mechanisms => opposite properties. Example at dim=4: CD (0% commutative), Clifford (83% commutative), Jordan (100% commutative). The 83% gap between CD and Clifford and the 100% gap between Clifford and Jordan are not dimensional effects-they are MECHANISM effects. The doubling formula (CD with conjugation asymmetry in right component), the anticommutation rule (Clifford e_i*e_j=-e_j*e_i), and the symmetric product (Jordan {a,b}=(ab+ba)/2) each force a distinct commutativity class. This principle implies: (1) Commutativity and associativity classes are algebraic invariants, not tunable parameters; (2) Metric signatures (gamma, (p,q)) control zero-divisor distributions, NOT fundamental property classes; (3) Dimension determines WHICH properties are possible within a construction (e.g., CD associativity at dim=4 but not dim=8), not WHAT property class the construction inherits. This fundamental distinction explains why tessarines (tensor product C<U+2297>C) are fully commutative despite being 4D like quaternions, and why split-octonions (split-CD signature) retain CD's non-commutativity despite changing metric parameters.

Phase 3d synthesis discovers a fundamental trade-off law: increasing commutativity comes at the cost of losing associativity.

The pattern suggests: to force universal commutativity (100%, Jordan's symmetric product), the algebra must sacrifice associativity. To maintain associativity (Clifford), only 80-90% commutativity is possible. To have full associativity AND non-commutativity requires a 0% commutative construction (CD). This trade-off is STRUCTURAL, not dimensional: A<U+2082> (3D Jordan) is non-associative by design; CD at dim=4 is associative by formula (identity still holds despite non-commutativity). The trade-off persists across dimensions: A<U+2081> (1D Jordan) is associative but trivial (1 element); A<U+2082> (3D Jordan) is non-associative (proper Jordan). This law implies: no single algebra family can simultaneously achieve 100% commutativity AND full associativity AND zero-divisors in a non-trivial (dim>1) setting.
