Specifically: (1) the skybox G x G grid at each CD level N encodes a fractal-like pattern whose invariants (box-kite count scaling, emptiness clustering exponent, DMZ density) should match invariants of a Coxeter limit set with matching rank, and (2) the spectroscopy band transitions (Dense/Sparse/Mixed behaviors across 8-strut blocks) encode discrete jumps in Coxeter diagram connectivity."
