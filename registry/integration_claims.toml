title = "Signed-Graph Frustration as Viscosity Source (Thesis 1 Foundation)"

id = "CRI-002"
title = "Two-Phase LBM-APT Isomorphism (Collision/Streaming vs Phi1/Phi2)"
statement = "The D3Q19 lattice Boltzmann method's collision/streaming split is mathematically isomorphic to the PhaseScheduler trait's two-phase coordination (phi_1, phi_2). Phase 1 (collision) prepares state via BGK operator; Phase 2 (streaming) executes redistribution and validates. This enables deterministic timing guarantees for LBM evolution, bridging historical timing abstraction (4-bit ISA) with modern fluid simulation."
