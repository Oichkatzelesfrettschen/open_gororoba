TX-1 (significant): The non-monotonic alpha dependence suggests a resonance
between frustration density and collision dynamics. At low alpha (< 0.5),
frustration modulation perturbs the walk weakly. At alpha=0.5, the
perturbation is maximal (delta_gamma=0.19). At high alpha (> 5.0),
the frustration field saturates the collision probability and gamma
returns to the reference value.

TX-2 (null): The viscosity-to-filtration loop does NOT produce a
deterministic latency law because the projection from 3D velocity field
to 1D latency spectrum loses too much information. All R^2 values are
below 0.60 regardless of lambda. This is a genuine decoupling: the
macroscopic flow structure does not encode the microscopic collision
statistics directly.

TX-3 (paradox resolved): The sigmoid model produces W_2=0 (identical
topology to frustration) despite Spearman=0.64 because the sigmoid
compresses the dynamic range. The point cloud overlap is 1.0 (every
frustration subregion maps to a sigmoid value within the same region),
but the CV of regional means is 0.001 (all regions give nearly the same
sigmoid value). The topology is preserved but the rank ordering is lost
to compression."""

The 44x onset catastrophe occurs because the CD interpolation breaks
integrability at ANY nonzero lambda. The XXX Heisenberg chain is
Bethe-ansatz solvable with fully ballistic transport (D_S = D_S_max).
Any perturbation away from the integrable point opens a gap in the
energy spectrum that suppresses transport. This is a quantum phase
transition in the transport channel.

The 83.4x enhancement at f=3/8 connects algebraic structure to transport:
the vacuum attractor frustration level corresponds to a specific lambda
on the interpolation path where the Drude weight has a particular value.
This is NOT a coincidence -- the frustration index of the sedenion
multiplication table determines the effective coupling constants of the
spin chain, and those constants determine the transport properties.

The Stolpp Lifshitz-point mechanism (alpha=1/4 in J1-J2 language) provides
independent confirmation. At the Lifshitz point, the single-particle
dispersion splits from one minimum to two, doubling the number of low-energy
carriers and enhancing transport. Our 30,778x D_S enhancement at alpha=1.1
is consistent with Stolpp's ~15x K_th enhancement -- the difference in
magnitude comes from stronger field (B=3.0 vs M=0.4 saturation) and
finite-size effects (N=10 vs thermodynamic limit)."""

far exceed the thresholds (T1: 2x, T4: 1.66x), providing margin.
