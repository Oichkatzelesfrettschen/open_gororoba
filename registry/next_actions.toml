The GF(2) twist exponent psi(i,j) forms a 2x2 matrix per edge; its anti-diagonal XOR eta characterizes the pure/mixed partition. F invariant in GF(2)^2 has 1 zero state (pure) and 3 nonzero (mixed), forcing 1:3 combinatorially. Verified at dims 16/32/64/128/256 (13.3M+ triangles, 0 mismatches). Key claims: C-515..C-527, I-018."
