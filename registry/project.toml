summary = "Phase 2: Exhaustive algebra variant family census across construction methods and metric signatures. Phase 2a (Week 1): Quaternion family commutativity census (4 tests, C-550/C-551/C-552, I-020/I-021/I-022). All 4 gamma signatures at dim=4 non-commutative (structural property); zero-divisor count scales with gamma (parametric property). Phase 2b (Week 2): Octonion family census (3 tests, C-553/C-554, I-023). All 8 gamma signatures at dim=8 non-commutative; standard octonions division algebra (0 ZD pairs), composition law verified. Discovery: Commutativity is construction-dependent (CD doubling) and dimension-dependent, but GAMMA-INVARIANT (metric signature irrelevant). Zero-divisor count GAMMA-DEPENDENT. Extends hierarchy: Construction Method >> Dimension >> Gamma Parameter. Tests now 975 (963 before Phase 2 work). Total gains: 2 new claims (C-553, C-554), 1 new insight (I-023), confirmed structural vs parametric property distinction at dim=4 AND dim=8."

summary = "dim=512 Anti-Diagonal Parity Theorem verified (214M triangles, 0 mismatches, C-531). psi/eta tower extended to dim=2/4/8: quaternion antisymmetry, octonion Fano plane (7 lines, 5+/2-), psi=1 fraction converges to 50% (C-532..C-534). dim=1024 frustration ratio 0.37849 (C-535): post-peak monotonic decrease confirms convergence toward 3/8. Legacy CSV cross-validation (C-536..C-544): ZD adjacency matrices REFUTED (same-parity artifact), universal anti-commutativity of CD basis elements VERIFIED (0% commuting at all dims 4-128), quaternion Lie brackets VERIFIED, octonion associators VERIFIED (168/210=80% nonzero, alternativity confirmed), property retention errata documented (legacy incorrectly says dim>=16 lacks R,C,H sub-algebras), hyperquaternion table completed (6 sign flips = doubling convention), E6/Extended matrices NOT multiplication tables (eigenvector decompositions), Moonshine-CD connection REFUTED (C-543), psi=1 exact formula (n+1)/(2n) proved (C-544). Bit-parallel iterative cd_basis_mul_sign_iter (1.2x) and bit-packed SignTable (17x speedup, O(1) lookup). Parameterized CD construction (C-545..C-549): CdSignature type with per-level gamma, split/standard/mixed signatures, split-complex j^2=+1 with zero-divisors at dim=2, CD always non-commutative at dim>=4, split-octonion signature (4,3) with 128 ZD pairs, dim=4 all 3 non-standard signatures have 16 ZD pairs each, split-octonion psi=1 fraction = 3/8 (matches frustration convergence limit). 16 split-CD tests. cd-tower-report binary: comprehensive 8-section tower analysis (property retention, psi convergence, ZD geometry, face sign census, frustration, split-CD, scaling laws, theorems). scrolls_core crate and scrollify-csv binary for CSV-to-TOML canonicalization."
