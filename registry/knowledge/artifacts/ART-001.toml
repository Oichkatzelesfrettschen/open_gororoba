By explicitly computing the third-order homotopy product $m_3$ using the tree-level Homological Perturbation Lemma (HPL) formula, we identify a distinct \"42 vs 168\" splitting in the non-trivial associator triples. This distribution aligns exactly with the structure of the exceptional Lie group $G_2$ and the automorphism group of the Fano plane, $PSL(2,7)$, confirming that our \"Surreal-Noncommutative\" toy model correctly captures deep algebraic symmetries of the bulk geometry.\n\n---"

In our framework, we treat the \"bulk\" spacetime as a higher-dimensional algebra (Sedenions) and the \"boundary\" observables as a lower-dimensional projection (Octonions).\n\nTo formalize this projection, we use the **Homotopy Transfer Theorem (HTT)**. We view the Sedenions as a deformation of the Octonions and ask: *What is the effective algebraic structure on the Octonions if we integrate out the Sedenionic degrees of freedom?* The answer is an $A_\ninfty$-algebra, where associativity is replaced by a hierarchy of higher operations ($m_3, m_4, \\dots$)."
