# Convos Claims Inbox (Triage Queue, ASCII-only)

Purpose: extract claim-like content from `convos/` and convert it into
testable, source-indexed entries (eventually tracked in
`docs/CLAIMS_EVIDENCE_MATRIX.md` + `docs/CLAIMS_TASKS.md`).

Policy:
- `convos/` content is treated as input/transcript, not authoritative.
- Nothing here is \"verified\" until it has (a) primary sources cached with
  provenance and (b) an offline check (test/verifier) in-repo.

Primary scan artifact:
- See `reports/convos_claim_candidates.md` for the raw hit list (auto-scan).

## High-priority new program claims (from convos/another_chat.md)

These do not currently appear (by keyword) in `docs/CLAIMS_EVIDENCE_MATRIX.md`.
Treat them as a research-program decomposition, not as established results.

### INBOX-PROG-001: Geometry from operator data (spectral emergence)

- Statement: \"Spacetime geometry emerges from a Planck-scale discrete operator
  (more precisely: from a spectral triple (A,H,D_geom), not from eigenvalues
  alone).\"
- Status: promoted to `docs/CLAIMS_EVIDENCE_MATRIX.md` as C-403 (program claim).
- Minimum assumptions to make precise:
  - A1: access to operator-algebraic data richer than eigenvalues (e.g.
    commutators [D_geom, a], heat-kernel traces, projectors).
  - A1b: explicit equivalence class of reconstructions (isometry? conformal?
    coarse-grained graph isomorphism?).
- Failure mode to address explicitly:
  - Inverse spectral non-uniqueness (\"isospectral non-isometric\" examples).
- Candidate primary sources (to cache under `data/external/...`):
  - Connes, \"Noncommutative Geometry\" (book) and/or reconstruction theorem papers.
  - Classic inverse spectral counterexamples (\"can one hear the shape of a drum\").
- Candidate in-repo validation hooks:
  - A toy spectral-embedding pipeline on graphs (Laplacian eigenmaps / diffusion
    maps) with regression tests on known graphs.
  - A \"non-uniqueness\" demo: two non-isomorphic graphs with shared spectrum.

### INBOX-PROG-002: Bulk locality from modular data (holography)

- Statement: \"Bulk locality and reconstructability are defined by boundary
  modular generators K_A = -log rho_A and entanglement wedges (operator-algebra
  QEC viewpoint).\"
- Status: promoted to `docs/CLAIMS_EVIDENCE_MATRIX.md` as C-404 (program claim).
- Minimum assumptions to make precise:
  - A2: modular completeness for a semiclassical code subspace.
- Candidate primary sources:
  - RT/HRT (Ryu-Takayanagi + covariant generalization).
  - Entanglement wedge reconstruction; JLMS; holographic QEC (Almheiri/Dong/Harlow).
  - Bit threads (Freedman/Headrick) as max-flow formulation.
- Candidate in-repo validation hooks:
  - A small tensor-network toy model where region entropies match a max-flow
    computation and reconstructability can be checked.

### INBOX-PROG-003: Observers as correctable record algebras (open systems)

- Statement: \"Macroscopic observers correspond to metastable, approximately
  correctable record algebras selected by open-system dynamics L_open.\"
- Status: promoted to `docs/CLAIMS_EVIDENCE_MATRIX.md` as C-405 (program claim).
- Minimum assumptions to make precise:
  - A3: existence of a stable (approximate) fixed-point / decoherence-free
    subalgebra supporting records; redundancy resembles a repetition code.
- Candidate primary sources:
  - GKSL / Lindblad generator foundations.
  - Decoherence + pointer states (Zurek); Quantum Darwinism.
  - Operator-algebra QEC (Benyi et al.); decoherence-free subspaces (Lidar/Whaley).
- Candidate in-repo validation hooks:
  - A small finite-dimensional Lindblad simulation with an explicit fixed-point
    algebra test (channel commutant / noiseless subsystem).

## High-priority lacunae to close (from user notes)

These are \"thesis hardening\" tasks; each should become a tracked claim with a
decision rule.

### INBOX-GAP-001: Box-Kite uniqueness under automorphisms

- Problem: sky map should be invariant (or enumerated) under the relevant
  automorphism group; otherwise \"picked the Box-Kite that worked\" objection.
- Status: promoted to `docs/CLAIMS_EVIDENCE_MATRIX.md` as C-406 (method claim).
- Work needed:
  - Enumerate automorphism-inequivalent Box-Kites.
  - Run the full null-model + look-elsewhere correction across that family.

### INBOX-GAP-002: Look-elsewhere accounting

- Problem: quoted p-values are conditional unless trial factors are explicit.
- Status: promoted to `docs/CLAIMS_EVIDENCE_MATRIX.md` as C-407 (method claim).
- Work needed:
  - Track all tuned hyperparameters (smoothing scale, alignment choices, etc.).
  - Provide conservative global p-value bounds (Bonferroni-style is acceptable).

### INBOX-GAP-003: Symmetric falsification criteria

- Problem: need explicit disconfirmation thresholds (not only \"needs more data\").
- Status: promoted to `docs/CLAIMS_EVIDENCE_MATRIX.md` as C-408 (method claim).
- Work needed:
  - State an N_min and a p-value / effect-size criterion below which the
    hypothesis is rejected.

### INBOX-GAP-004: Uncertainty visualization

- Problem: visuals should encode variances (GW sky localization, projection
  uncertainty, Monte Carlo envelopes).
- Status: NOT YET promoted to claims matrix.
- Work needed:
  - Add density contours / credible regions; avoid point-only plots.

## Next triage action

1. Confirm promoted items (C-403..C-408) remain source-indexed and have offline
   checks/verifiers.
2. For each promoted claim, create a paired `docs/CLAIMS_TASKS.md` row with:
   - source-index doc path(s)
   - cached primary source path(s) + provenance
   - offline validation test/verifier target(s)
3. Promote INBOX-GAP-004 (uncertainty visualization) once a concrete plotting
   artifact + verifier is scoped (credible regions, Monte Carlo envelopes).

## Shortlist (2026-02-01)

See `reports/convos_claim_candidates_prioritized.md`.
