## Open Items (Forward-Looking)

### Registry and Documentation Governance

0) **Complete TOML centralization for markdown mirrors** (Sprint 13)
   - `registry/knowledge_sources.toml` now indexes all tracked markdown files.
   - `registry/knowledge/docs/*.toml` now stores raw markdown capture (non-authoritative landing layer).
   - Curated operational registries added: `registry/roadmap.toml`, `registry/todo.toml`,
     `registry/next_actions.toml`, `registry/requirements.toml`.
   - Claims support registries now normalized:
     `registry/claims_tasks.toml`, `registry/claims_domains.toml`,
     `registry/claim_tickets.toml`.
   - `make registry` is now TOML-first by default; legacy markdown ingest is
     explicit via `make registry-ingest-legacy`.
   - Exporters now generate TOML-driven markdown mirrors under
     `docs/generated/*_REGISTRY_MIRROR.md` for insights, experiments, roadmap,
     todo, next-actions, requirements, claims-tasks, claims-domains, and claim-tickets.
   - Exporters also regenerate claims-support legacy mirrors:
     `docs/CLAIMS_TASKS.md`, `docs/claims/INDEX.md`,
     `docs/claims/CLAIMS_DOMAIN_MAP.csv`, and `docs/claims/by_domain/*.md`.
   - Mirror freshness is now enforced by
     `src/verification/verify_registry_mirror_freshness.py`.
   - Registry generators now emit deterministic stamps to avoid one-time timestamp churn.
   - Remaining policy decision: fully replace legacy narrative docs or keep
     them as non-authoritative overlays.
   - Keep markdown as human-facing mirrors, generated where practical.

### High Priority

1) **Multiplication coupling rho(b) in GL(8,Z)** (C-466, Sprint 9 open question)
   - The scalar shadow pi(b) = signum(sum) is verified for addition mode.
   - The full multiplication coupling rho(b) acting on lattice vectors remains open.
   - This is the key missing piece for a complete lattice-algebra dictionary.

2) **Primary-source citation for every claim** (ROADMAP 7.2)
   - Systematic sweep through CLAIMS_EVIDENCE_MATRIX.md.
   - Add missing WHERE STATED and bibliographic references.
   - Sprint 8 did 10 claims; ~200+ remain without primary sources.

3) **Paper-ready LaTeX pipeline** (ROADMAP 7.5)
   - `make latex` build from verified results.
   - Structured \"hypotheses + tests + results\" format.
   - Priority target: ultrametric core mining (I-013) or lattice codebook (I-015).

### Medium Priority

4) **Twist-delta pair correspondence** (I-016 open question)
   - Twist navigation targets {h,v} have h XOR v != source_strut in many cases.
   - Need to identify which Fano-plane quantity governs each twist transition.
   - Related to brocade normalization (different central-trip choices may align).

5) **Full lanyard classification from signed graph** (I-016)
   - L16 infrastructure is in place (signed graph -> lanyard extraction).
   - Systematic census of all cycle types across all 7 BKs not yet done.
   - Goal: formal bijection between ET edge signs, lanyard types, and de Marrais terminology.

6) **GF(2) separating degree at dim=64** (I-012 open question)
   - At dim=32, the 8/7 motif split needs a cubic GF(2) polynomial.
   - At dim=64 (4 motif classes, PG(4,2)), minimum separating degree is unknown.
   - Does the degree grow with the doubling level?

5) **Extend parity-clique and XOR partner to dim=128+** (Sprint 9 open)
   - Parity-clique verified at dims 16, 32. XOR partner verified at dim=64.
   - dim=256 ZD adjacency is computationally infeasible (132M evaluations).
   - dim=128 may be tractable with optimized code paths.

6) **External data provenance automation** (B.7)
   - Query params for HEASARC fetches.
   - Automated provenance checks in CI.

### Low Priority / Long-Term

7) ~~**Mass \"clumping\" hypothesis test** (A.4)~~ -- DONE (Sprint 8: mass-clumping binary)
8) ~~**Experiments portfolio shortlist** (C.9)~~ -- DONE (Sprint 8)
9) ~~**Fast basis-element multiplication table generator** (ROADMAP 4.2)~~ -- DONE (Sprint 8: CdMultTable)
10) ~~**Materials science second dataset** (ROADMAP 7.3)~~ -- DONE

11) **Coq/Rocq formalization** (ROADMAP 7.4)
    - Decide semantics for `has_right`/`reachable_delegation`.
    - Prove a minimal non-trivial theorem end-to-end.

12) **Lex-prefix filtration and octonion subalgebra connection** (Sprint 9 open)
    - The 8D lattice dimension matches the octonion dimension.
    - Is this a coincidence or does the octonion subalgebra structure
      directly constrain the lattice embedding?

13) **GPU tensor network contraction** (ROADMAP 8)
    - Extend cudarc GPU path beyond ultrametric testing.
    - Target: PEPS boundary contraction for larger system sizes.
