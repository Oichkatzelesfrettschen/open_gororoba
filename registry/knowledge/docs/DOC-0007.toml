# Curated Artifacts (Legacy / Mixed Provenance)

`curated/` is a legacy artifact store that predates the repo's current reproducibility guardrails.
It contains a **mix** of:

- reproducible outputs produced by scripts under `src/` (usually plots/CSVs written into `curated/`)
- AI-generated / hand-edited tables that are **not** currently tied to generating code

Treat anything in `curated/` as **non-authoritative** unless it is:
1) generated by a committed script, and
2) validated by tests or a verifier under `src/verification/`.

## Provenance snapshot

- `curated/PROVENANCE.local.json` records SHA256 + size + mtime for every file currently under `curated/`.
  This supports \"what changed?\" audits but does **not** by itself establish scientific provenance.

## Directory notes

- `curated/01_theory_frameworks/`: Coq stubs + theory-adjacent artifacts (many CSVs are not yet reproducible).
- `curated/02_simulations_pde_quantum/`: simulation/plot artifacts (some scripts write here, but most CSVs
  are not yet backed by validated models).
- `curated/03_benchmarks_numeric/`: numeric benchmark tables (largely not yet reproducible).
- `curated/04_observational_datasets/`: \"observational\" CSVs (requires cross-checking against first-party sources).
- `curated/05_summaries_indexes/`: summary/index artifacts.
