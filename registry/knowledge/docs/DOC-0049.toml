# Qiskit Environment Setup & Troubleshooting

**Date:** January 26, 2026
**Status:** Resolved via Docker Containerization

## 1. Problem Analysis
Attempts to install `qiskit-aer` directly on the host system (CachyOS Linux) failed due to:
*   **Compiler Mismatch:** The system uses GCC 15.2.1, which is too new for the `conan` build configuration used by `qiskit-aer` source builds.
*   **Python Version:** The system runs Python 3.14.2 (beta), for which no pre-built binary wheels exist for `qiskit-aer` or `numpy` versions compatible with it.

## 2. Resolution: Containerization
We have bypassed these constraints by creating a stable, isolated environment using Docker.

*   **Base Image:** `python:3.11-slim` (Stable, supported by Qiskit wheels).
*   **Dependencies:** Pre-installed `qiskit`, `qiskit-aer`, `qiskit-ibm-runtime`, and scientific stack.
*   **Setup:**
    *   `docker/Dockerfile`: Defines the environment.
    *   `run_quantum_container.sh`: Wrapper script to run simulations and persist data.

## 3. Usage Guide

### Prerequisites
*   Docker installed and running.

### Running Simulations
To execute any Qiskit script located in `src/`:

```bash
./run_quantum_container.sh [script_path_inside_container]
```

**Example:**
```bash
./run_quantum_container.sh src/quantum/local_test.py
```

### Adding New Dependencies
1.  Edit `docker/Dockerfile`.
2.  Rebuild: `docker build -t qiskit-env -f docker/Dockerfile .`

## 4. GPU Acceleration (Optional)
Currently, simulations run on CPU. To enable CUDA acceleration:
1.  Ensure `nvidia-container-toolkit` is installed on the host.
2.  Modify `run_quantum_container.sh` to include the `--gpus all` flag in the `docker run` command.
