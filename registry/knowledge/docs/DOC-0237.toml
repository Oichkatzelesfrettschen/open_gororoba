# Repo Inventory (2026-02-01)

Scope: `/home/eirikr/Playground/ChatGPT Experiments`

## Top-level directories (depth<=2)

- `archive/` (legacy snapshots)
- `benchmarks/` (microbenchmarks and study harnesses)
- `bin/` (repo scripts and verifiers)
- `convos/` (immutable chat transcripts, may contain Unicode)
- `cpp/` (C++ components)
- `curated/` (curated artifacts and theory folders)
- `data/` (artifacts, cached externals with provenance, reproduced datasets)
- `docker/` (container build for quantum environment)
- `docs/` (repo-authored documentation; ASCII-only)
  - `docs/convos/` (ASCII-only extracts derived from `convos/` PDFs)
  - `docs/external_sources/` (external-source indices and summaries; excluded from overclaim gate)
  - `docs/preregistered/` (preregistered plans; excluded from overclaim gate)
- `examples/` (small runnable examples)
- `reports/` (generated human-readable reports; ASCII-only)
- `src/` (Python source code)
- `tests/` (pytest suite)

## File counts (approx; excludes `.git/`, `venv/`, and caches)

- `src/`: ~987 files
- `data/`: ~688 files
- `curated/`: ~621 files
- `tests/`: ~577 files
- `docs/`: ~212 files
- `convos/`: ~20 files

## Repo gates (high level)

- ASCII-only gate: `make ascii-check` (repo-authored content; `convos/` exempt)
- Warnings-as-errors gate: run checks/tests with `PYTHONWARNINGS=error`
- Overclaim-phrase gate: `src/verification/verify_no_overclaim_phrases.py`
- External provenance coverage: `src/verification/verify_external_provenance_coverage.py`

## Working tree notes

If `git status` shows many modifications/deletions/untracked files, treat this as a staging area:
the evidence-first workflow expects incremental batches, each ending with `PYTHONWARNINGS=error make check`.
