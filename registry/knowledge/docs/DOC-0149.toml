# Reggiani 2024 manifold identifications (C-005)

Access date: 2026-01-28

Scope: this file records what is asserted in Reggiani (arXiv:2411.18881) about
manifold identifications for sedenion zero-divisor sets. The repo does not
replicate the Riemannian geometry/isometry proofs; it only aligns definitions
and validates algebraic invariants.

## Key claims (paper-asserted)

The paper states (paraphrase, see PDF for full proofs):

1) Z(S) is (homeomorphic / diffeomorphic) to G2, and the induced metric makes it
   isometric to G2 with a particular left-invariant metric.

2) ZD(S) is isometric to the Stiefel manifold V2(R7) (also presented as G2/SU(2))
   with a specific G2-invariant metric family.

## Repo status

- Definitions aligned: `docs/SEDENION_ATLAS.md`
- Algebraic checks: `tests/test_reggiani_alignment.py`, `tests/test_reggiani_standard_zero_divisors.py`
- Manifold/isometry claims: not replicated; treat as paper claims unless a
  dedicated geometric computation or independent verification is added.
