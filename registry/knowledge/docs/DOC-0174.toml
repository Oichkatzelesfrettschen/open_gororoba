# Warp Ring Physics Reconciliation (Phase 7.0)

## Overview
This manifest formalizes the three-layer physical model for the \"Warp Ring\" analogue gravity experiment, reconciling the cinematic \"Silicon-Gold-Ice VIII\" narrative with literature-supported optical constants and numerical methods.

## Layer A: Ray Dynamics (Hamiltonian Optics)
We solve the ray equation for isotropic gradient-index (GRIN) media as parameterized by arclength $s$:

$$\\frac{d}{ds} \\left( n \\mathbf{T} \\right) = \\nabla n$$

where $\\mathbf{T} = \\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{ds}$ is the unit tangent vector to the ray. 

### Numerical Implementation
- **Integrator**: 4th-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) for stable ray bending in high-gradient regions.
- **Adaptive Stepping**: $dt$ is controlled by both the distance to the torus surface (SDF) and the local curvature curvature $|
abla n|/n$.

## Layer B: Material Constants (1550 nm)
The \"Silicon-Gold-Sapphire\" stack is modeled using homogenized effective medium constants.

| Material | Interpreted Role | Literature Value (n) | Model Value (Used) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Silicon** | Front Lens (Contraction) | 3.476 (Li, 1980) | 3.48 |
| **Gold** | Resonant Trap (Ergoregion) | 0.19 + i 10.35 (Babar, 2015) | $\\epsilon = -107.1 + 3.9i$ |
| **Sapphire** | Dielectric Matrix | 1.746 (Malitson, 1962) | 1.746 (Rigorous) |

*Note: The \"Cinematic\" n=2.5 for Ice VIII is deprecated in favor of the Sapphire literature value (n=1.746).*

## Layer C: The \"Plasmon -> Parton\" Power Pipeline
Instead of stochastic state changes, we implement a field-based energy bookkeeping model.

1. **Absorption**: When a ray intersects the gold torus, energy is deposited based on the Fresnel absorption coefficient $\\alpha \\propto \\text{Im}(\\epsilon)$.
2. **Surface Mode (Plasmon)**: Absorbed energy populates a surface field $P(\\theta, \\phi)$ that advects tangentially along the ring with group velocity $v_{spp}$.
3. **Vacuum Decay (Parton)**: The $P$ field drives a secondary, fast-decaying jitter field $Q$. $Q$ is rendered as the high-entropy red \"Parton\" shower, representing the breakdown of the analogue vacuum.
