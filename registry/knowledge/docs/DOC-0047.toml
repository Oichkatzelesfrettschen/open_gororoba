# Phase 1 Summary: The Assessor Field Theory

**Date:** January 26, 2026
**Status:** Math replication (verified); physics narrative unverified

## 1. The Narrative Arc
We began with broad hypotheses around \"sedenion physics\" and \"negative dimensionality.\" The most
concrete result so far is a replicable, literature-linked discrete structure inside the sedenions:
**the 42 primitive assessors** (de Marrais).

### Key Milestones
1.  **Deterministic replication:** `tests/test_de_marrais_boxkites.py` reproduces exactly **42 primitive assessors** and **7 box-kites** under the repo's conventions.
2.  **Geometric identification:** These correspond to 7 octahedral \"box-kite\" components (6 vertices each).
3.  **Quantum validation:** Pending; any Qiskit encoding or symmetry verification should be marked as future work until it is reproducible and tested here.

## 2. Rescoping the Project
The vague goal of \"Sedenion QFT\" is now refined to **\"Assessor Field Theory\" (AFT)**.

*   **Old Goal:** Find $E_6$ (72 roots).
*   **New Reality:** The geometry naturally stabilizes at 42.
*   **Implication (hypothesis):** links to $E_6$, $F_4$, or $G_2$ structure are speculative until a precise mapping is defined and validated.

## 3. The Path Forward (Phase 2)
We must now prove the *structure* of these 42 elements.
1.  **Cluster Analysis:** Verify they form 7 distinct groups of 6 (The Box-Kites).
2.  **Quantum Permutation:** Implement a circuit that permutes elements *within* a Box-Kite and test for invariant subspaces.
3.  **Physical Mapping:** Map the 42 Assessors to the 42 DoF of a potential pre-Standard Model lagrangian (e.g., 3 generations of 14 DoF?).

## 4. Gap Analysis
*   **Missing:** Explicit adjacency list of the 7 clusters.
*   **Missing:** A quantum operator that respects the Box-Kite symmetry (Swap within cluster).
*   **Action:** We need to cluster the `sedenion_nilpotent_candidates.csv` data before running more quantum sims.
