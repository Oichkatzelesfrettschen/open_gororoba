# Insights

The insights registry tracks 16 discoveries (I-001 through I-016) in
`registry/insights.toml`.  Each insight records a significant finding or
interpretation from the computational census.

## Insight catalog

| ID | Title | Status | Sprint |
|----|-------|--------|--------|
| I-001 | Macquart Relation Fills the Comoving Distance Gap | Verified | S6 |
| I-002 | Ultrametric Structure Lives in Representations, Not Scalars | Verified | S6 |
| I-003 | Existing Rust Crate Ecosystem for Cosmological Analysis | Verified | S6 |
| I-004 | Kodama Dendrogram and Real Observational Cosmology | Verified | S6 |
| I-005 | Ultrametric Structure is Radio-Transient-Specific | Superseded | S6 |
| I-006 | Motif Census Scaling Laws (dim=16..256) | Verified | S6 |
| I-007 | Kerr Geodesic Integrator Verification Summary | Verified | S6 |
| I-008 | Cross-Domain Ultrametric Analysis (5K Subsampling) | Superseded | S7 |
| I-009 | Elliptic Integral Crate Eliminates Carlson Port | Verified | S6 |
| I-010 | nalgebra 0.33/0.34 Version Split Blocks Autodiff | Open | S6 |
| I-011 | GPU Ultrametric Sweep (9 catalogs) | Verified | S7 |
| I-012 | The Pathion Cubic Anomaly | Verified | S8 |
| I-013 | The Hierarchy Fingerprint Theorem | Verified | S7 |
| I-014 | Cayley-Dickson External Data Cross-Validation | Cross-validated | S8 |
| I-015 | Monograph Theses Verification (Lattice Codebook) | Verified | S9 |
| I-016 | De Marrais Emanation Architecture | Verified | S10 |

## Supersession chain

I-005 and I-008 are marked **superseded** because the GPU sweep (I-011) with
10 million triples revealed that 5K subsampling destroyed the Hipparcos galactic
spatial signal, making the earlier \"radio-transient-specific\" conclusion too narrow.
