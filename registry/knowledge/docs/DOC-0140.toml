Abstract: Building on two prior studies of zero-divisors (ZD's) generated by the Cayley-
Dickson process, algebras we call \u201Clariats\u201D (Line Algebras of Real and Imaginary Axis
Transforms), linkable to quantum measurement, are discovered in the Sedenions, com-
plementing the 7 isomorphic \u201Cbox-kites\u201D (pathway systems spanning octahedral lattices)
interconnecting all primitive ZD's. By switching \u201Cedge signs,\u201D products among the diago-
nal line-pairs associated with each of a box-kite's 4 triangular, vertex-joined, \u201Csails\u201D gen-
erate not 6-cyclic ZD couplings when circuited, but 28 pairs of structures with Quaterni-
onic multiplication tables \u2013 provided their symbols represent the oriented diagonals as
such, not point-specifiable \u201Cunits\u201D residing on them. If a box-kite's 3 \u201Cstruts\u201D (pairs of
opposite vertices, the only vertex pairings which do not contain mutual ZD's) each be
combined with the ZD-free Quaternion copy uniquely associated with said box-kite, 21
lariats with Octonionic multiplication, one per each box-kite strut pair, are generated.
Extending this approach to \u201Cemanation tables\u201D (box-kite analogs in higher 2n-ions) indi-
cates further ZD-masking \u201Csleeper cell\u201D structures, with \u201Crenormalization\u201D's basis possib-
ly amenable to rethinking, thanks partly to the ZDs' newfound \u201CTrip Sync\u201D property,
inhering throughout the 2n-ion hierarchy.

\u000C0. Zero-Divisors and Box-Kites Thus Far . . .
         It's been common knowledge since the 19th Century that, by use of a simple algo-
rithm dubbed the \u201CCayley-Dickson Process\u201D (CDP), one can start with the real numbers,
then progressively double dimensions to yield, in sequence, the Imaginaries, Quaternions,
Octonions, Sedenions, and general 2n-ions. For almost as long, it's also been known that
each such doubling causes increased flexibility in some senses, but loss of crucial struc-
ture in others: order relations and uniqueness of powers break down with Imaginaries
(without whose angular power law, however, and remarkably simple relationship to ste-
reographic projection, modern mathematics and wave mechanics would be unthinkable);
Quaternions don't commute (thanks to which \u201Cfailure,\u201D the vector-mechanical description
of real forces in the physical world is derivable); Octonions are non-associative (making
cause-effect relationships untraceable, but quark confinement and M-Theory's \u201Cbrane
scan\u201D thinkable). Beyond these 8-D imaginaries, though, Hurwitz showed a century ago
(see Kantor and Solodovnikov) that the very notions of \u201Cfield\u201D and a metrical \u201Cnorm\u201D fall
apart, thanks to the appearance of a new kind of \u201Cmonster\u201D: the zero-divisor.
         Non-zero numbers whose product is zero at first seemed pathological, but are now
\u2013 thanks to quantum mechanical \u201Cprojection operators\u201D and their formal link to \u201Cobserva-
bles\u201D \u2013 quite acceptable in \u201Cmixed\u201D company. That is, if one defines a space with not just
reals and imaginaries, but Pauli-spin-matrix-based \u201Cmirror numbers\u201D too, whose non-real
units square to +1, then the Clifford Algebras which allow them all to intercommunicate
necessarily contain zero divisors. These, however, are of a special sort: if the \u201Cmirror
number\u201D unit be written as \u201Ce,\u201D then the two quantities \u00BD (1 \u00B1 e) are not just idempotents
(hence algebraic analogs of \u201C1\u201D's among Reals) on two orthogonal axes in a 4-D \u201Cbicom-
plex\u201D space; more, they have zero for their product \u2013 which product obtains for any pair
of points taken one from each axis. (As we'll see, the association of the zero-divisor pro-
perty with lines of numbers, not just points, has quite far-reaching consequences.)
         In \u201Chypercomplex\u201D spaces spanned only by the real axis plus lines whose units
square to \u20131, however, the emergence of zero divisors is more problematic, and long re-
mained poorly understood. In the 16-D Sedenions, the first extension of the imaginaries
where they announce themselves, it took until 1998 before Guillermo Moreno showed a
homomorphism between zero-divisor structure and the automorphism group of the Octo-
nions, whose Coxeter-Dynkin diagram is known in the argot of the \u201CA, D, E\u201D classifica-
tion as \u201CG2\u201D \u2013 and not just in the Sedenions, but in all higher 2n-ions (since G2 is also the
\u201Cderivation algebra\u201D upon whose backbone all higher CDP imaginaries articulate them-
selves). But: homo- is not iso-, and concrete methods for extracting and studying zero-
divisors were still lacking . . . until the Fall of 2000.
         In the first paper in this series, a remarkably simple method was demonstrated for
generating, and studying the interconnections among, all Sedenion zero-divisors. By em-
ploying (among the literally hundreds of billions of options) a scheme for labeling the 15
imaginary axes based strictly on XOR calculations (the index of iA times iB will always be
A xor B), and conforming to CDP-generated signing patterns, zero divisors were shown
to fill 84 diagonal lines, spanning 42 planes dubbed \u201CAssessors,\u201D the axes of the latter be-
ing simply derived as follows: pick any arbitrary Octonion 'o' (index 1-7, for 7 choices),
and any pure Sedenion 'S' whose index is greater than 8 and not equal to the XOR of 'o'
with 8 (for 6 choices); then all points on the orthogonal diagonals o \u00B1 S will be zero-divi-
sors, but never with points on each other. Rather, diagonals from different Assessors will
mutually zero-divide each other, according to easy-to-visualize path-selection rules.
\u000C         The visualizing strategy was based on placing labels for each of the 42 Assessors
on exactly 1 of the 6 vertices of 1 of 7 isomorphic octahedral lattices (the \u201CBox-Kites\u201D),
then taking products of points along one or the other diagonal associated with each neigh-
boring vertex, according to an \u201Cedge-signing\u201Dprotocol. If the sign along the edge adjoin-
ing 2 vertices is \u201C+,\u201D this indicates the product of similarly oriented diagonals (both either
o + S or o \u2013 S: hence, \u201C/\u00B7 /\u201D or \u201C\\\u00B7 \\\u201D); if the sign is \u201C\u2013,\u201D then only pairings of oppositely
oriented diagonals (\u201C/ \u00B7 \\\u201D or \u201C\\ \u00B7 /\u201D) will mutually zero-divide. But how allocate the edge-
signs? And, even more fundamentally, how partition the 42 Assessors among the 7 Box-
Kites? Upon answering the second, we will see the first question almost answers itself.
         We state without proof the Strut Constant Rule: each of the 7 ways of excluding 1
of the 7 Octonions, whose index we'll call the \u201Cstrut constant,\u201D s, results in a set of 6
which can be mapped directly to 6 vertices of precisely one Box-Kite; moreover, the
index of the Sedenion making an Assessor with each, is the XOR of the given Octonion
with the \u201Cexcess\u201D X = 8 + s. Designate each Box-Kite with the Roman numeral of its
strut constant. Box-Kite I thus has these 6 Assessor index-pairs at its vertices: (2 \u00B1 11),
(3 \u00B1 10), (4 \u00B1 13), (5 \u00B1 12), (6 \u00B1 15), (7 \u00B1 14). (That is, 2 xor 11 = 3 xor 10 = 4 xor 13 =
5 xor 12 = 6 xor 15 = 7 xor 14 = X = 8+1 = 9.) These 6 are further partitioned into mutu-
ally non-zero-dividing pairs (the struts): those 3 couplings whose Octonions' XOR would
yield the missing strut-constant-indexed Octonion. With s = 1, the Assessor pairs with
Octonions indexed respectively by 2 and 3, 4 and 5, and 7 and 6, would sit at opposite
ends of diagonals (each playing that role for 2 orthogonal squares) on the octahedral
lattice. We write 7 and 6 out of counting order, because that is their signing order in the
most common XOR-based indexing scheme: the 7 Octonion triplets (\u201CO-trips\u201D), each
forming a Quaternion copy with the reals, are listed, lowest index first, in left-right, then
cyclical sequence, so that each successive pair's product in an O-trip is positively signed:

         (1, 2, 3); (1, 4, 5); (1, 7, 6); (2, 4, 6); (2, 5, 7); (3, 4, 7); (3, 6, 5)

         The strut-pairings just considered, then, are written in cyclic order as (2, 3); (4, 5);
(7,6). The 3 terminal indices can always be rearranged to form an O-trip in ascending
signing order (ASO) per the above list: (3, 6, 5) for Box-Kite I. Use this fact to mutually
orient strut-pairs as follows: pick a triangle on the octahedron, label vertices A, B, C, and
place \u201C\u2013\u201D signs on the edge-lines between them. Label vertices at opposite ends of their
struts F, E, D respectively, putting \u201C\u2013\u201D signs on their triangle's edge-lines, and \u201C+\u201D signs
on the 6 remaining edges. For Box-Kite I, set (A, B, C) to (3, 6, 5), hence (4, 7, 2) to F,
E, D, in that order. O-trips now fill the vertices of 4 of the Box-Kite's 8 triangles, which
we call \u201CSails.\u201D These share no edges, touching only at vertices, separated checkerboard-
style by 4 \u201Cempty\u201D triangles we call \u201CVents.\u201D The other Sails are (A, D, E), (F, D, B) and
(F, C, E), these 3 having only 1 \u201C\u2013\u201D edge-sign each. (All such letter triplets represent in-
dices in signing order sequence \u2013 which, for Box-Kites I, II, III, are all \u201CASO\u201D as well.)
         Multiplying Assessors in sequence around a Sail's vertices, according to the edge-
signing rule, a 6-cyclic listing of zero-divisor couplings results. Start with the (\u2013 \u2013, ++)
diagonal at A; circuiting (A, B, C) in Box-Kite I yields this progression: (i3 + i10)(i6 \u2013 i15)
= (i6 \u2013 i15)(i5 + i12) = (i5 + i12)(i3 \u2013 i10) = (i3 \u2013 i10)(i6 + i15) = (i6 + i15)(i5 \u2013 i12) = (i5 \u2013 i12)(i3 + i10)
= 0. Observe, too, that in any Sail, each vertex's Octonion forms a Quaternionic axis-trio
with the other 2 vertices' Sedenions, all 21 such \u201CS-trips\u201D with no \u201C8\u201D in them appearing
only in such contexts, precisely once each among the 7 (A, B, C) Sails.
\u000C1. Groups, Loops and Lariats
        For the reader's convenience, the 28 S-trips are listed in signing order below, fol-
lowed by a \u201CStrut Table\u201D which shows Box-Kite structures per the above specifications.
The only column in the table which will seem strange to those who haven't read the first
monograph in this series (henceforth, \u201CBK1,\u201D with its successor shorthanded \u201CBK2\u201D) is
the second: explaining what GoTo numbers are, though, will take us to our next topic,
where new material will begin to reveal itself.

                  (2, 8, 10)        (2, 9, 11)      (2, 14, 12)     (2, 15, 13)
                  (3, 8, 11)        (3, 10, 9)      (3, 15, 12)     (3, 13, 14)
                  (4, 8, 12)        (4, 9, 13)      (4, 10, 14)     (4, 11, 15)
                  (5, 8, 13)        (5, 12, 9)      (5, 10, 15)     (5, 14, 11)
                  (6, 8, 14)        (6, 15, 9)      (6, 12, 10)     (6, 11, 13)
                  (7, 8, 15)        (7, 9, 14)      (7, 13, 10)     (7, 12, 11)

        Note that the first column of S-trips contains the index-8 imaginary, and hence
none of these appear in any Box-Kite Sails. They do, however, play a central role, since
each contains precisely and only those indices forbidden from appearing in precisely 1
Box-Kite. In the first monograph, the offending index number's unique tagging of a
\u201Ctame\u201D kind of Quaternionic 3-sphere, in conjunction with the well-known billiards-based
phrase for the unplayability of shots one is forced to take behind it, suggested calling such
a zero-divisor-bereft S-trip an \u201C8-ball.\u201D When its actions are treated in conjunction with
those of its associated Box-Kite, we will see some surprises will be waiting for us. Be-
fore we get to those, though, here's the promised aid to Box-Kite building, followed with
an explanation of the \u201CGoTo Numbers\u201D column.

\u000C         In the listing of O-trips in ASO sequence given above, the 7 were put in ascending
order, as sorted by first digit, then second if necessary. The \u201CGoTo numbers\u201D refer to O-
trips by this indexing scheme, indicating thereby 7 \u201COctonion counterfeits\u201D whose non-
real axes consist of the given O-trip plus the 4 Sedenions which aren't indexed by 8, the
strut constant, or the XOR of these two. For each Box-Kite, 4 such numbers are listed,
indicating in the order written the 4 \u201COctonion counterfeits\u201D from which the 4 successive
Sails (which we now list with edge-signs inserted) derive. For Box-Kite I, \u201C7, 6, 4, 5\u201D
means the pattern of zero-divisors in A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013 is uniquely contained in the 7-dimensional
space spanned by imaginaries with indices 3, 6, 5 (ABC's O-trip), plus 9, 10, 12 and 15;
Sail A+D\u2013E+ is embedded in the space whose axial indices are (3, 4, 7, 9, 10, 13, 14);
Sail F\u2013D+B+ is linked to (2, 4, 6, 9, 11, 13, 15); and F+C+E\u2013, to (2, 5, 7, 9, 11, 12, 14).
         In BK1, these 8-D algebras were called \u201Cautomorphemes,\u201D with each Assessor
appearing in 2 of them. It was shown, as well, that they were not isomorphic to the Octo-
nions, as their O-trips' signing orders could never be made consistent with the \u201Ctrue\u201D
Octonions, as deviations always appear in at least 2 O-trip sequences, no matter how one
transformed among labeling schemes. Raoul Cawagas has recently corroborated that all
the primitive Sedenion zero-divisors indeed inhere in such algebraic objects, which he
showed by his FINITAS algebraic software package correspond to a hitherto unidentified
kind of loop-theory entity, which he calls a \u201Cquasi-octonion loop,\u201D or \u00D5L, This has almost
the same properties as the standard Octonion NAFIL (for Non-Associative Finite Inverti-
ble Loop), the 16-element maximal subloop (+ and \u2013 values of each axial unit), short-
handed OL , of the Sedenions' 32-element loop. The signal difference between them is the
former's failure to satisfy the Moufang identity. More, the Sedenions possess 7 copies of
this non-Moufang loop, whose axis systems' imaginaries have indices identical to our
\u201Cautomorpheme\u201D listings.
         The Sedenions, as Cawagas showed, also possess 7 extra copies of the standard
Octonion loop, each constructed by taking one of the 7 O-trips, then supplementing it
with the 4 Sedenions whose indices are 8 and the XOR's of 8 with the O-trip. (Further
subloops correspond to the smaller, quite familiar groups: the 35 Quaternion copies (7
O-trips + 28 S-trips); 15 4-cycles associated with the imaginaries; the 2-cycle of the plus
and minus real units; and, the trivial 1-element additive group corresponding to 0.) Our
septet of \u201C8-balls\u201D clearly appear as subloops within these, each appearing in 3 (1 per
each O-trip containing its strut constant). This listing exhausts the groups and loops
housed in the Sedenions, but not all the interesting algebras. The largest of the latter also
have Octonion multiplication tables, with each 8-ball also appearing in 3 different ones;
but as we'll soon see, they are far from identical to the creatures we've just looked at!
          The new kind of algebra captures the breakdown of metric norms \u2013 and shows it
as distinct from (and, in fact, prior to) the emergence of zero-divisors. These \u201Clariats\u201D are
adjustable loops, hence metrically indeterminate, which helps explain their name; but
their designation is also an acronym, for Line Algebras of Real and Imaginary Axis
Transforms, with the stress on the first word: for the entities whose behaviors are tracked
in lariat multiplication tables are oriented lines comprising numerical axes, not length-
fixed \u201Cunits\u201Dresiding at specifiable locations on same. The \u201Cstretchy\u201D nature of zero divi-
sor pairings, where the choice of points to multiply taken from each is arbitrary, is thereby
captured . . . but without the zero-division property itself becoming manifest. Lariats,
then, are like \u201Csleeper cells\u201D: the zero-dividing \u201Cterrorism potential\u201D of some of their ele-
ments may only become apparent when contexts shift, with no warnings given.
\u000C2. 8-Ball + Box-Kite = Switching Yard
         It is a staple of silent-movie melodramas like \u201CPerils of Pauline\u201D: the heroine is
tied to the railroad tracks by a moustachioed villain in black; the hero arrives almost too
late, but saves the day by throwing his weight against a large switching-yard lever arm
which moves the rails (and thereby redirects the rushing train) just in the nick of time.
         After contemplating the simplicity and structural richness of Box-Kites, it is hard
to believe it had been assumed for a century that divisors of zero were pathological enti-
ties with nothing recommending their study. But now we've seen them, a child-like ques-
tion arises: what happens if you change the edge-signs and multiply the \u201Cwrong\u201D line ele-
ments together? If (i3 + i10)(i6 \u2013 i15) = 0, what about (i3 + i10)(i6 + i15)? And what system of
relations, if any, obtains between such \u201Cswitched\u201D products and our octahedral lattice?
         As part of the answer, switch all the \u201C\u2013\u201D signs to \u201C+\u201D in Box-Kite I's ABC Sail:
we now orbit the vertices in near-group-theory style, in a 3-cycle, two per sail. Whether
we pick the \u201C/\u201D diagonal as in the last paragraph, or the \u201C\\\u201D, as long as we're consistent, it
doesn't matter: kA \u00B7 kB = 2k2 \u00B7 C, kB \u00B7 kC = 2k2 \u00B7 A, kC \u00B7 kA = 2k2 \u00B7 B. Hence, if we set k
= \u00BD, we almost have a group: \u00BD (i3 + i10) \u00B7 \u00BD (i6 + i15) = \u00BD (i5 + i12). The would-be group,
though, is non-commutative, as signs on products flip when term orders reverse. But we
don't have even a non-Abelian group, since recalibrating per above gives us A2 = B2 = C2
= \u2013 \u00BD , which is clearly only half of what we need to get a Quaternion \u201Cworking copy\u201D!
         To add to the confusion, picking proper \u201Cunits\u201D on such zero-divisor axes, so as to
create isomorphs of the complex plane, requires a different calibration: the radius of the
circle in the Argand diagram requires k be set not to \u00BD, but the square root of \u00BD! This
of course makes the case for reading a sign-switched \u201CSail\u201Das a Quaternion copy even
worse, since the 3 non-real axes can no longer be subgroups without being \u201Ctuned.\u201D
         This is the motivation for the lariat construct: for if all calibrations be ignored,
and only the placement and orientation of diagonal line elements be considered, we see
that each Sail consists of 2 Quaternion-like lariats, with the caveat that instead of the real
unit serving as identity, the (positively oriented) real axis as a whole does (call it a life-
line). This is readily shown true for all \u201Csign-switched\u201D Sails: the other 3 now have 2 \u201C\u2013\u201D
and 1 \u201C+\u201D edge-signs, but otherwise yield 2 sets of \u201CQuizzical Quaternions\u201D each.
         Corresponding to William Rowan Hamilton's famous formula, we can write 2
\u201Cijk\u201D-style one-liners to capture this behavior for each Sail. Call the axis of reals \u201CR,\u201D
and use upper and lower case letters to stand for the (\u2013 \u2013, ++) or \u201C/\u201D and (\u2013 +, + \u2013) or \u201C\\\u201D
diagonals respectively: \u201CA\u201D now means (i3 + i10), while \u201Ca\u201D stands for (i3 \u2013 i10). Show the
switched edge-signs between the Sail's vertices, and here's what we get:

                        A+B+C+:         A2 = B2 = C2 = ABC = (\u2013 R)
                                        a2 = b2 = c2 = abc = (\u2013 R)

                        A\u2013D+E\u2013:         A2 = d2 = e2 = Ade = (\u2013 R)
                                        a2 = D2 = E2 = aDE = (\u2013 R)

                        F\u2013C\u2013E+:         F2 = c2 = E2 = FcE = (\u2013 R)
                                        f2 = C2 = e2 = fCe = (\u2013 R)

                        F+D\u2013B\u2013:         F2 = D2 = b2 = FDb = (\u2013 R)
                                        f2 = d2 = B2 = fdB = (\u2013 R)
\u000C         It is curious to relate the \u201C/\u201D and \u201C\\\u201D flips in the list just given to the correlated or-
dering of S-trip signings in each case. As mentioned at the end of the introductory sec-
tion, each pair of Octonions in each Sail's O-trip can be replaced with their associated
Sedenions, yielding an S-trip which circuits the same 3 Assessors. Only with ABC, how-
ever, whose edge-signs are all \u201C\u2013,\u201D are orientations maintained consistently: e.g., (3, 6, 5);
(3, 15, 12); (10, 6, 12); ( 10, 15, 5) all cycle in left-right order. With the other Sails, 2
orientations are always reversed, with only the S-trip whose Octonion is shared with ABC
displaying the same cycle order as its own O-trip. Striking enough to merit a name, as the
\u201CTrip-Sync Property,\u201D this fact should prove quite powerful in future simulation studies
of emergent order, and \u201Cfirefly tree\u201D-type synchronization, especially among ensembles of
Box-Kite-guided waves or particles \u2013 a theme we'll touch upon from other angles later
on. For now, though, we return to lariats, to see what others the Sedenions might house.
         If we include an 8-Ball with its proper Box-Kite, we find that the two diagonals at
each end of a strut combine with the 8-Ball's \u201Ctrue copy\u201D of the Quaternions, producing a
lariat of \u201CMock Octonions.\u201D This is demonstrable by direct calculation, provided we set
up good notation. Use \u201CR\u201D and upper vs. lower casing as per above; make \u201C8\u201D stand for
the unit with that index, and \u201CS\u201D for the unit indexed by the strut constant; then, write \u201CX\u201D
for the unit whose index is the \u201CXOR\u201D of 8 with the strut constant. If we next pick A and
F as our strut pair, we can build a \u201CMock Octonion\u201D multiplication table as follows:
writing our symbols in the sequence (R, 8, X, S; F, a, f, A), we get the same table as if
we'd associated these with the standard reals, and imaginaries indexed 1 \u2013 7, respectively.
         The same occurs if we substitute the other two struts: instead of \u201CF, a, f, A\u201D em-
ploy \u201CE, b, e B\u201D or \u201CD, c, d, C\u201D to the same effect . . .which means each pairing of Box-
Kite with 8-Ball yields 3 isomorphic \u201CMock Octonion\u201D lariats, as claimed earlier, for 21
in all. (As opposed to 2 x 4 x 7 = 56 \u201CQuizzical Quaternion\u201D lariats.) Here's the table:

         The 8-Ball's Quaternion group is highlighted in the upper left quadrant; F and A
stand in for the indices of the strut-pair represented by those letters on a given Box-Kite
lattice. An isomorphic table results if E and B (and e and b), or D and C (and d and c),
are substituted for F and A (and f and a) respectively. As with the Quizzicals, upper case,
for a given Assessor, indicates the (o + S) or \u201C/\u201D diagonal; lower case, the (o \u2013 S) or \u201C\\\u201D.

         Putting together the Box-Kite and 8-Ball associated with same strut constant, we
get 1 of 7 isomorphic, 16-dimensional, \u201CSwitching Yards\u201D: the table given above can be
used to instantiate them all, per the substitution rules given in the text. The 8-Ball \u201Ctrue
Quaternion\u201D subtable is shaded upper-left, and is contained in all 3 Mock Octonion lariats
associated with a given strut constant. For easy parsing, the remaining \u00BE of each such
lariat are similarly color-coded. The zeros associated with the product-pairings along a
Box-Kite's 12 edge-signs take up 48 of the table's 256 cells, and are painted pale yellow.
(The simple task of eking out the octet of Quizzicals' identity-element-less \u201Cijk-tables\u201D
from the remaining 8 x 6 white cells is left as an exercise for the curious.)
         In the above, zero-divisors have been sufficiently \u201Ctamed\u201D to make contemplating
their uses where most needed \u2013 in quantum theory. Some hints to this effect have been
dropped in what's already been said. In the pages that remain, we'll pursue these further,
plus other oddments which haven't been broached yet. It is implicit that \u201Clariats\u201D suggest
a rather deeper answer to how Uncertainty works than just passing the buck to \u201Cprobabili-
ty waves\u201D; for such an ascription to make sense, the vice of the \u201CN Squares Rule\u201D break-
down \u2013 shown long ago by Cayley's friend Kirkman to create a never-ending passalong
to higher 2n-ions, if the product space Sedenions implicate is to be closed \u2013 must be
turned into a virtue: which suggests some rethinking of what \u201Crenormalization\u201D means,
and why it is called for in the first place. And then there are some other things . . .
\u000C3. Switching-Yard Exotica: \u201CTrigram Currents\u201D and the \u201CDJ Play-List Problem\u201D
         Say \u201C+\u201D on an edge-sign is seen as green, while \u201C\u2013\u201D appears as red. If we \u201Cthrow
the switch\u201D on all edge-signs at once, Sail ABC and Vent DEF reverse colors. But if we
are viewing the square formed by any 2 struts from atop the third, changing \u201C+\u201D to \u201C\u2013\u201D
would appear like a 90\u00BA rotation (along all 3 struts simultaneously, in fact). What were
called \u201Ctray-racks\u201D in this series' first installment are the 4-cycles of zero-producing pro-
ducts we get when traversing the edges of any of the Box-Kite's 3 squares: B\u2013C+E\u2013D+;
A\u2013C+F\u2013E+; A+D\u2013F+C\u2013. Toggling signs shifts sequences, but doesn't change them.
         On the first effect, it's easy to see we get a 3-bit code uniquely telling us which
Sail, in which switch-state, we're looking at. The patterns we get, in fact, are precisely
those of the \u201Ccoin oracle\u201D method of creating I Ching readings. With 3 heads, or 2 tails
and 1 head, we get a \u201Cyang\u201D line: ABC, FDB, ADE, FCE give + + +, + \u2013 \u2013, \u2013 + \u2013, \u2013 \u2013 +,
respectively, meaning we're in the land of \u201Clariats,\u201D where products conceivably yield up
indeterminate \u201Cmeasurement quanta\u201D as allowed by Quaternionic or Octonionic represen-
tation schemes. But 3 tails, or 2 heads and 1 tail, yield a \u201Cyin\u201D line instead: the \u201Czero-
division\u201D condition, with the 4 Sails now bit-mapped to \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 , \u2013 + +, + \u2013 +, + + \u2013 .
         If we then map \u201C\u2013 \u201D to 0, and \u201C+\u201D to 1, we get the 3-bit code, and then can start
wondering about what sort of \u201Cbreathing\u201D would govern such yin-yang yoyo-ing. (And
just as crucial would be grasping \u2013 perhaps via simulation studies of the \u201Ccellular automa-
ton\u201D variety \u2013 how 2 or more Box-Kite \u201Cparticles\u201D might interact, or which \u201Chexagrams\u201D
might result from their exchanges under different conditions.) Given that the second pa-
per in this series showed how the analogs of Box-Kites in higher 2n-ions can be decom-
posed or \u201Cfolded\u201D into the simpler forms found in the Sedenions, the study of such \u201Ctri-
gram currents\u201D might prove quite illuminating.
          But now let's take a look at the second effect mentioned above: the \u201Crotation\u201D of
tray-racks A\u2013C+F\u2013E+, A+D\u2013F+C\u2013, B\u2013C+E\u2013D+. Unlike the 2 types of 6-cycles (one, for
A\u2013 B\u2013 C\u2013 only, called a \u201Ctriple zigzag\u201D due to its \u201C/ \\ / \\ / \\\u201D alternation pattern; the other,
obtaining for the other 3 Sails, dubbed a \u201Ctrefoil\u201D after the same-named knot), the alter-
nating signs bring a tray-rack circuit back to the diagonal it started with in just 4 steps, so
that 2 such circuits of the same quartet of Assessors (1 starting with a \u201C/\u201Ddiagonal, the
other with a \u201C\\\u201D) are required to \u201Ccover all the bases.\u201D
         But if we \u201Cthrow the switch\u201D to get lariats instead of zero-division sequencing,
each tray-rack circuit generates 2 of the 4 terms comprising the 3rd strut orthogonal to its
plane in the Box-Kite octahedron \u2013 suggesting the cross-product familiar in vector calcu-
lus, but also having a unique higher-dimensional analog in the Octonions, which product
is preserved in the Octonions' automorphism group, G2 \u2013 which, since Moreno's work, we
know governs zero-divisor structure, too, in the Sedenions as well as all higher 2n-ions.
         Geoffrey Dixon has further shown how varieties of Octonion vector products can
generate the Barnes-Wall and Leech lattices in 16- and 24- D, respectively. These not
only play critical roles in \u201Cclosest sphere-packing\u201D and self-correcting error-code theories,
but in M-Theory (the 16-D \u201C4,320-packing\u201D being the basis of the O(32) string). Even
more compelling, Dominic Joyce's holonomy manifold with G2 symmetry is currently
seen as the most likely candidate for harboring the 7 \u201Ccurled-up\u201D gauge-dimensions of M-
Theory. Making this seem even less a coincidence, the G2 Joyce manifold is generated by
a system of 7 x 7 equations which readily reduce to 35: viz., 7 O-trips, linked 1-to-1 with
the 7 \u201C8-Balls,\u201D with the triple-zigzag's substitution symmetry linking each such pairing
uniquely to 3 S-trips, for 5 x 7 = 35 Quaternion copies in all, 1 per each Joyce generator?
\u000C         To replace the \u201C?\u201D with a \u201C.\u201D in that last sentence, we need to investigate what
might be termed the \u201CDixon-Joyce circulatory system\u201D: we know we can get from the G2
manifold to the Barnes-Wall lattice, hence M-Theory. We can imagine 35 equations each
tracking one of the 35 Quaternion copies in the Sedenions. Which raises the \u201CDJ Play-
List Problem\u201D: how do we get from the \u201Cplay list\u201D of Barnes-Wall circuits Dixon's Octo-
nion vector-products give us, to Sedenion orbits, and thence back down to Joyce's 35
choices? In the 8-D space of Octonions, there is an exact correspondence between the
240 \u201Cclosest-packed\u201D hyperspheres there and Octonion arithmetic, as Coxeter's classic
study of \u201CIntegral Cayley numbers\u201D made clear. But the link between closest-packing and
number theory breaks down in higher dimensions; there are many different systems for
navigating 16-D spaces, whose interrelationships are hardly as well-mapped as those in
spaces of 8 dimensions or less.
         The other 16-D-lattice-based string theory, \u201CE8 x E8,\u201D is shown in M-Theory to be
transformable into O(32), the latter comprising the objects at distance 2 on the same lat-
tice whose unit-distance objects yield the famous anomaly-free \u201C496\u201D of the former: E8
is just the \u201CA, D, E Classification\u201D code corresponding to the Cayley numbers, and twice
240 + 16-D Cartan subalgebra yields the \u201Cmagic number.\u201D And this setup does have an
easily identified (if not so well-known) hypernumber equivalence: to the so-called \u201CM-
algebra\u201D posited by Charles Mus\u00E8s a quarter century ago. Just as the 4-space of reals plus
Pauli spin-matrices is isomorphic to the Quaternions, Mus\u00E8s made use of the 2 x 2 iden-
tity matrix, with the usual imaginaries replacing the \u201C1's,\u201D to commute between the 2
spaces (in effect, building the Clifford algebra Cl3), then used the matrix to commute be-
tween the Octonions and an \u201Cextended Pauli\u201D 8-space, which 2 spaces (by the same argu-
ment used in 4-D) are isomorphic. Their total 16-D arithmetic, then, \u201Cspans\u201D E8 x E8 \u2013
albeit not as \u201Cnicely\u201D as Octonions relate to integral Cayley numbers. What is of signal
interest, however, is the fact that, real axis aside, the Sedenions are pure imaginaries, but
Mus\u00E8s's M-algebra is a projection-operator-rich \u201Chalf and half.\u201D Yet M-Theory transforms
between the O(32) and E8 x E8 string theories. What clean transformations exist between
Sedenion and \u201CSwitching Yard\u201D arithmetics, and both Joyce and Dixon's domains?
         One more 16-D space in need of interrelating arises when the icosahedral reflec-
tion group (\u201CH3\u201D in \u201CA, D, E\u201D argot) is studied in singularity theory: members of Ar-
nol'd's school showed a correspondence to a 16-D manifold with a 4-D boundary singu-
larity \u2013 this latter so-called \u201Copen swallowtail\u201D being a symplectic manifold in its own
right . . . and first instance of an infinite family of symplectic invariants, per the Givental'
theory of \u201Ctriads.\u201D The link between symplectic and Quaternionic being self-evident, and
the fact that Moreno's paper showed a 4-D \u201Cboundary\u201D in Sedenion space, in the sense of
\u201Cfree of zero-divisors\u201D (i.e., isomorphic to an \u201C8-Ball\u201D), one is led to wonder if there is
some connection here \u2013 and if so, whether Gabrielov's triads relate, in turn, to the infinite
sequence of 2n-ions (and hence, to some deep link between G2 and H3 in this context).
         All of which suggests that the \u201Cpathology\u201D of zero-divisors, far from marking the
end in the road of useful extensions of the imaginary domain, may well mark the start of a
new journey, to hitherto unvisited places. And, as lariats and whatever other \u201Csleeper
cell\u201D structures hiding in higher dimensions can smuggle disguised zero-divisors into
much lower-dimensioned algebras than suspected (with implications we can only begin to
imagine for quantum foundations), so too we must allow for the possibility that much of
what passed for Nature's architecture in 20th Century physics may prove to be removable
scaffolding.
\u000C4. Post-Script on the \u201CTrip-Sync Property,\u201D and Mathematical Beauty
         Lab data displaying evidence of Chaos was, prior to that theory's emergence, typi-
cally tossed in the trash as so much \u201Cexperimental error.\u201D Higher imaginaries containing
zero divisors have likewise been dismissed, with the sort of superficial ugliness easily
observed in the distribution of \u201CStrut Table\u201D S-trips \u2013 nicely mapped one per slot in ABC,
it's true, but with 2 or 3 occurences of the same S-trip, with compensating absences of
others, in the other 3 Sails \u2013 taken as endemic. But we've seen we can even contemplate
a bonafide representation theory for zero divisors thanks to lariats, and find an astonish-
ing degree of orderliness among S-trips thanks to the \u201CTrip-Sync\u201D property \u2013 the very
property which underwrites the emergence of Sedenion zero-divisors in the first place.
Beauty is not just in the mind of the beholder; it inheres in objective structures \u2013 but will
only be perceived by those who open themselves to it without prejudice. Readers are
invited to confirm the tabulation below with the evidence provided in the earlier listings
of O-trips and S-trips, the better to rid themselves of any such aesthetic impediments.

\u000C        \u201CTrip-Sync\u201D is not some \u201Cnice\u201D feature obtaining in the Sedenions only. On the
contrary, it seems to be a fundamental property of Box-Kites at whatever level, as one can
readily verify in the 32-D world of the Pathions. The signal distinction between this are-
na and the 16-D Sedenions' is that the \u201Cemanation tables\u201D therein \u2013 multiplication tables
involving 2n-1 \u2013 2 entities, with one 2n-ion (whose index s < 2n-1 is the strut constant) ex-
cluded from each \u2013 interconnect multiple Box-Kites, defined in the Pathions by 4-, not 3-
bit, XORing. But for s \u2264 8, each such 14-vertex entity decomposes into 7 Box-Kites, all
showing \u201CTrip-Sync\u201D behavior. Take the O-trip associated with the ABC \u201Ctriple-zigzag\u201D
in the Sedenion Box-Kite for the same s, then add '8' to the associated Sedenion in each
Assessor to get the analogous Pathion. Using this Box-Kite as base-line, get the rest by
successively keeping one strut-pair unchanged, but substituting for the other 2 pairs, in 1
of the 2 ways the 8 \u201Cextra\u201D Assessors allow. For s = 1, the 14 Pathion Assessors' S and P
indices (as opposed to Sedenions' o \u00B1 S) all have \u201Cinner XOR\u201D of 16 + 1 = 17, as follows:

 2,19 4,21 6,23 8,25 10,27 12,29 14,31 15,30 13,28 11,26 9,24 7,22 5,20 3,18

         By the same \u201Cnested parentheses\u201D logic used with Sedenions, successive pairings
of outermost terms form struts, from (2, 19) and (3, 18) to (14, 31) and (15, 30). (See p.
14 of BK2 to find edge-signs given for the full \u201Cemanation table.\u201D) The 7 Box-Kites can
be put in a table analogous to the \u201CStrut Table\u201D provided above \u2013 but, s being the same
for all, sequencing results from holding each of the 3 struts constant, while replacing the
others in both ways that let ABC be an ASO S-trip, all 7 listed in ABC order:

                               A       B       C       D       E       F
Base-Line Box-Kite:            3       6       5       4       7       2
AF kept constant:              3      10       9       8      11       2
                               3      13      14      15      12       2
CD kept (& moved to AF):       5      12       9       8      13       4
                               5      14      11      10      15       4
BE kept (& moved to AF):       6      11      13      12      10       7
                               6      15        9      8      14       7

         Use the P-trip lists in BK2 to confirm. When s = 8, the logic given fails, since no
O-trip with an '8' can underwrite Sedenion ZD's. Here, however, what happens instead
is that one still gets 7 Box-Kites, but the ABC Sail in each is uniquely associated with
one of the 7 O-trips. For higher s, carry-bit \u201Celbow room\u201D runs out and \u201Csand mandalas\u201D
with only 3 Box-Kites result (see BK2), all 3 sharing strut (s \u2013 8, 8). (Hence, using the 7
Sedenion Box-Kites as our \u201Cstarter kit,\u201D we build 8 x 7 = 56, plus 7 x 3 = 21, for 84
Pathion Box-Kites all told: 1 per each Sedenion 8-Ball, Quizzical Quaternion and Mock
Octonion lariat, and ZD diagonal, respectively.) For s = 9, for instance, we get this trio:

                                  A      B       C       D       E        F
Base-Line Box-Kite:            (2, 27) (8, 17) (10,19) (3, 26) (1, 24) (11, 18)
\u201CFirst Harmonic\u201D:              (4, 29) (8, 17) (12,21) (5, 28) (1, 24) (13, 20)
\u201CSecond Harmonic\u201D:             (7, 30) (8, 17) (15,22) (6, 31) (1, 24) (14, 23)

       Trip-Sync holds here too. Prove, qualify, or refute: it holds for all 2n-ions, n > 3.
