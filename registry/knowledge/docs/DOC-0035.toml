# Gap Analysis & Future Expansion

**Date:** January 26, 2026
**Status:** Audit Complete

## 1. Missing / Broken Artifacts
*   **Hyperquaternion Table:** The legacy CSV was incomplete. **Action:** Re-generated fully rigorous `multiplication_table_8D.csv` and `multiplication_table_16D.csv` using the Python engine.
*   **LIGO Data:** The `Cleaned_LIGO_O3.csv` mentioned in logs is **missing** from the filesystem. **Action:** We must assume this was a \"Hallucinated Dataset\" in previous sessions. We will simulate a synthetic gravitational wave signal based on Sedenion entropy for future correlation.
*   **Negative Dimension Physics:** The theoretical notes described specific wave behaviors. **Action:** Implemented `src/neg_dim_pde.py` which successfully simulated the fractional Schrodinger equation ($\\alpha = -1.5$).

## 2. New Findings from \"Mining\"
*   **Toy operator behavior:** In the toy study `src/neg_dim_pde.py` with continuation parameter
    `alpha = -1.5`, the simulated wavefunction can concentrate rather than disperse under the chosen
    discretization. This is not evidence of literal \"negative-dimensional physics\"; treat it as a
    numerical behavior of a specific operator/parameter choice (see `docs/NEGATIVE_DIMENSION_CLARIFICATIONS.md`).
*   **Sedenion Table:** The 16D table is now a permanent artifact, allowing us to lookup any product $e_i e_j$ instantly without re-running algebra code.

## 3. Expansion Plan
We are **not** closing the project. We are pivoting to:
1.  **Synthetic Cosmology:** Since real LIGO data is missing, we generate a \"Sedenion Gravitational Background\" dataset.
2.  **Surreal-Quantum Bridge:** Map the Surreal Number tree (from `convos/`) to the Qiskit circuit states.
3.  **Open Endedness:** The repository is now a \"Living Laboratory.\"
