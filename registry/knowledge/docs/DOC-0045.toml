# Negative Dimension: What We Mean (and What We Do Not Mean)

This repo uses phrases like \"negative dimension\" in multiple places. This document makes the meaning explicit and separates (A) standard mathematics/physics usage from (B) speculative narrative.

## A) Standard meanings (\"negative dimension\" is shorthand)

### A1) Dimensional regularization (analytic continuation in d)

In dimensional regularization, one analytically continues integrals and differential operators from integer spatial dimension `d` to complex `d` as a *regulator parameter*.

Key point: `d` here is not \"a physical count of coordinates\"; it is a parameter in an analytic continuation scheme used to define otherwise divergent expressions.

Primary sources:
- 't Hooft and Veltman (1972)
- Bollini and Giambiagi (1972)

### A2) Parisi-Sourlas \"negative dimensions\"

Parisi-Sourlas uses supersymmetry and dimensional reduction in disordered systems; the phrase \"negative dimensions\" appears in that literature as part of the analytic/supersymmetric framework, not as a literal geometric space with negative coordinate count.

Primary source:
- Parisi and Sourlas (1979)

## B) Non-standard / speculative meanings (must be labeled as such)

Some `convos/` text assigns fractional/negative \"dimensions\" to number systems (dyadics, surreals, p-adics) or to Cayley-Dickson algebras. Those assignments are not standard and should not be presented as established mathematics unless tied to a published definition with citations.

Repo policy:
- Keep these ideas in the \"speculative\" lane.
- If we want them in the \"validated\" lane, we must (1) define them precisely, and (2) produce a reproducing computation (tests + artifacts) that implements that definition.

## C) What our current code actually implements

### C1) \"Negative diffusion\" plots

Code like `src/neg_dim_pde.py` / `src/neg_dim_spectrum.py` should be interpreted as *toy PDE operators with a continuation parameter*, not as a demonstration of physical spacetime having negative dimension.

### C2) Fractional powers (-Delta)^{alpha/2} and negative exponents

Expressions like `(-Delta)^{-s}` correspond to fractional *integral* operators (Riesz potentials) on suitable domains; details depend on boundary conditions (periodic vs bounded domain).

If a document claims a specific physical identification (e.g., \"D_eff = -1.5\"), it must be treated as a hypothesis and linked to:
- a precise operator definition,
- a domain/boundary specification,
- and a validation experiment that is reproducible.
