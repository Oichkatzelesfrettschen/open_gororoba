# Wheel Algebra Taxonomy

Extracted from conversation logs (convos/2_exploration_cont.md,
convos/1_read_nonuser_lines_cont.md). Content generated by ChatGPT in
conversation with the user. Mathematical claims are UNVERIFIED.

## IMPORTANT: Naming Collision

The conversation uses \"wheel algebra\" to denote a family of NON-ASSOCIATIVE,
NON-COMMUTATIVE algebras with cyclic multiplication structure. This is
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT from the Carlstrom/Setzer \"wheel\" that totalizes
division (implemented in crates/algebra_core/src/wheels.rs as WheelQ).

The two concepts share only a name. Do not conflate them.

## 1. Conversation's W_n Definition

A \"Wheel Algebra\" W_n of dimension n over field F:

    W_n = span_F {e_1, e_2, ..., e_n}
    e_i * e_j = sum_k omega_{ijk} e_k

Subject to:
- Non-associativity: (e_i * e_j) * e_k != e_i * (e_j * e_k) for some triples
- Cyclic multiplication: e_i * e_{i+1} = omega_i * e_{i+2}
- Structure constant antisymmetry: omega_{ijk} = -omega_{jik}

## 2. Taxonomy of Types

### 2A. Clifford-Wheel Algebras

    e_i e_j + e_j e_i = g_{ij} e_k

where g_{ij} is a metric with cyclic constraints. For W_3:

    e_1 e_2 = e_3,  e_2 e_3 = e_1,  e_3 e_1 = e_2

(Isomorphic to Z/3Z action on basis elements.)

### 2B. Octonionic Wheel Algebras (W_8)

Extends octonions with cyclic transformation T:

    T(e_i e_j) = e_{i (+) j}  (addition mod 8)

### 2C. Sedenionic Wheel Algebras (W_16, W_32)

Extensions to sedenions and beyond, relaxing norm composition while
maintaining cyclic symmetry.

### 2D. Lattice-Embedded Wheel Algebras

    e_i e_j = e_k + lambda * e_m

where lambda depends on lattice structure (E8, Leech, Coxeter):

    e_i e_j = sum_{k in Gamma} C_{ijk} e_k

### 2E. Twisted Wheel Algebras

    [e_i, e_j]_theta = e_k + theta * e_m

with twisting parameter theta governing algebraic phase shifts.

### 2F. Fractal Wheel Algebras

Recursive self-similar: W_n embeds fractally into W_{2n}.

### 2G. Surreal-Negative Wheel Algebras (SNAWAs)

Category SNAW with functor F: SNAW -> E (exceptional Lie groups).
STATUS: UNPROVEN. Acknowledged as speculative in conversation's own audit.

## 3. Exotic Integer Ring Families

These are STANDARD mathematics (well-defined, well-known):

### Gaussian Integers Z[i]
    Z[i] = {a + bi | a,b in Z},  i^2 = -1
    Norm: N(a+bi) = a^2 + b^2
    Unique factorization holds.

### Eisenstein Integers Z[omega]
    Z[omega] = {a + b*omega | a,b in Z}
    omega = e^{2*pi*i/3} = (-1 + sqrt(-3))/2
    Norm: N(a+b*omega) = a^2 - ab + b^2

### Hurwitz Integers
    H = {a + bi + cj + dk | a,b,c,d in Z or (1/2)Z}
    (includes half-integer components, unlike Lipschitz integers)

### Octavian Integers
    O = {a_0 + a_1*e_1 + ... + a_7*e_7 | a_i in Z or (1/2)Z}

## 4. What is NOT in the Codebase

Compared to the existing WheelQ (Carlstrom wheel of rationals):

1. W_n cyclic wheel algebras -- NOT implemented
2. Clifford-Wheel algebras -- NOT implemented
3. Lattice-Embedded wheel algebras -- NOT implemented
4. Twisted/exotic wheel algebras -- NOT implemented
5. Fractal recursive constructions -- NOT implemented
6. SNAWAs -- NOT implemented
7. Eisenstein integers Z[omega] -- NOT implemented
8. Octavian integers -- NOT implemented
9. Hurwitz integers -- NOT implemented (CD elements exist but not the
   integer sublattice)
10. Structure constant tensor omega_{ijk} -- NOT implemented

## 5. Critical Assessment

- The W_n \"cyclic wheel algebras\" have genuine mathematical content
  (cyclic permutation matrices, structure constants) but the connection
  to Carlstrom wheels is purely nominal.
- SNAWA definitions are speculative with no rigorous construction given.
- The exotic integer families (Gaussian, Eisenstein, Hurwitz, Octavian)
  are well-established standard mathematics.
- Computational \"validations\" in the conversations use random matrices,
  not actual algebraic structure constants.
