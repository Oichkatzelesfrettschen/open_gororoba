## Key Contributions

### 1. XOR Master Key for Index Multiplication

The *product of two 2^N-ion units* has as *its index the XOR of the indices*
of the units producing it. Example: i_7 * i_12 = +/- i_{7 XOR 12} = +/- i_11.

This is the foundational rule for all Cayley-Dickson algebras. Signs (not
indices) are what require the complex machinery of production rules.

### 2. Trip Generation Rules

**Rule 0 (Inherited trips):** All associative triplets from prior CDP
generations remain valid in all higher 2^N-ions. The 7 octonion NATO
triplets (1,2,3); (1,4,5); (1,7,6); (2,4,6); (2,5,7); (3,4,7); (3,6,5)
persist in all higher dimensions.

**Rule 1 (Generator trips):** The generator **G** = 2^N (the unique unit of
index 2^N in the 2^{N+1}-ions) produces same-signed resultants for all units
on the same side of the comma. For each unit with index L < G, the CPO
trip is (L, G, G+L). This completely explains quaternion indexing and
produces 3 of the 7 new octonion trips from the single quaternion trip.

**Rule 2 (Swap rule):** From any Rule 0 trip, hold one index fixed, add G to
the other two, and *switch their positions*. For octonions with G=4,
fixing 1,2,3 in the quaternion trip (1,2,3): (1, 3+4, 2+4) = (1,7,6);
(3+4, 2, 1+4) = (7,2,5) -> CPO (2,5,7); (2+4, 1+4, 3) = (6,5,3) -> CPO (3,6,5).

### 3. Trip Count Formula

Total trips in 2^N-ions = (2^N - 1)(2^N - 2) / 3!

- Quaternions (N=2): 1
- Octonions (N=3): 7
- Sedenions (N=4): 35
- Pathions (N=5): 155
- Chingons (N=6): 651

### 4. Zero-Divisor Construction Rule

For primitive ZDs in sedenions: take one unit with index L < G (7 choices,
any octonion), pair with one unit with index U > G where U is *not* the XOR
of L with G (6 choices each). This gives 7 * 6 = 42 Assessors.

### 5. Box-Kite-to-Semiotic-Square Mapping (ZD-Net Hypothesis)

Five-step mapping between ZD structures and Greimas's Semiotic Square:
1. ZDs inhibit synonymy -> \"meaning effects\" from Sails and Box-Kites
2. Strut-opposites (which do NOT zero-divide) and their 4 units obey
   \"XOR arithmetic\" equivalent to the Semiotic Square
3. Sails contain non-ZD substructures: Q-copies (associative triplets)
   and their \"Sailing partners\"
4. \"Trip Sync\" property enables \"message passing\" between Zigzag Q-copies
   through shared Assessors in Trefoils
5. The simplest non-elementary Catastrophe form (Equilateral) underwriting
   \"higher harmonics\" of Box-Kite representation

### 6. N-Squares Norms and Bott Periodicity

The n-squares norm law for 2^N-ions: (N, N, N) for N <= 8.
For sedenions (N=4): the (16, 16, 32) rule (Hurwitz's \"at worst\").
For higher ions (N = 3+k >= 4): **(2^N, 2^N, 2^{N+k})** -- 8D modularity.
This is the \"Bott periodicity\" signature.

                                      ABSTRACT

The objects of the great Nonlinear Revolutions \u2013 Catastrophes and Chaos in the 1960s-
70s (henceforth, CT); and, \u201Csmall-world\u201D and \u201Cscale-free\u201D Network Theory (NT), emerg-
ing from studies of synchronization since the Millennium \u2013 will be spliced together by a
New Kind of Number Theory, focused on digitizations (i.e., binary strings). NT nodes
then become \"feature-rich\" representations (nodules in a \u201Crhizosphere\u201D) of CT contents.

The \"Box-Kite\" formalism of zero divisors (ZD\u2019s) \u2013 first showing in the 16-D Sedenions,
then in all higher 2N-ions derived from Imaginaries by Cayley-Dickson Process (CDP) \u2013
can model such \u201Cenriched\u201D nodules. Its (bit-string XOR-ing vs. matrix-multiplication-
based) operations unfold into \"representations\" of the objects traditionally linked with
\u201Cpartitions of Nullity\u201D: Singularities. The route from this \u201Clocal\u201D level of CT to fractals
and Chaos, via CDP extensions to 2N-ions for growing N, will involve us in graphics of
higher-dimensional \u201Ccarry-bit overflow,\u201D as manifest in the mandala-like patterns show-
ing up in \u201Cemanation tables\u201D (the rough equivalent, for ZD's, of group theorists\u2019 Cayley
Tables). More concretely, this route will model semantic propagation \u2013 \u201Cmeaning\u201D itself.

I'll lead into this with a quote about \"Hjelmslev's Net\" (which I'll claim is the CDP man-
qu\u00E9) from a famous postmodern text deeply engaged with the philosophy of future mathe-
matics, Deleuze and Guattari\u2019s A Thousand Plateaus (where \u201Crhizosphere\u201D imagery
arose). From here, with strong assists from the CT-based structuralism of Jean Petitot,
Algirdas Greimas\u2019s \u201CSemiotic Square\u201D will show us how to explicitly link CT thinking to
the foundations of semantics via ZD \u201Crepresentations\u201D (Part III), while the infinite-
dimensional ZD meta-fractal or \u201CSky\u201D which Box-Kites fly \u201Cbeneath\u201D or \u201Cin\u201D \u2013 first
appearing in the 32-D Pathions and incorporating the higher 2N-ions, and the theme of
Part II \u2013 will provide sufficient lebensraum for L\u00E9vi-Strauss\u2019s \u201CCanonical Formula\u201D of
mythwork to unfurl in, thereby doing for semiotics what S-matrix methods promised for
particle physics. (These results serve to extend my NKS 2004 paper, available online at
the Wolfram Science website.)
\u000C0. Deep Background: Size vs. Place in the History of Number

       The ingenious method of expressing every possible number using a set of
       ten symbols (each symbol having a place value and an absolute value)
       emerged in India. The idea seems so simple nowadays that its significance
       and profound importance is no longer appreciated. Its simplicity lies in the
       way it facilitated calculation and placed arithmetic foremost amongst use-
       ful inventions. The importance of this invention is more readily appreci-
       ated when one considers that it was beyond the two greatest men of Anti-
       quity, Archimedes and Apollonius.

                           Pierre-Simon, Marquis de Laplace1

        From the vantage of traditional Number Theory, based on Quantity and Measure,
and a notion of \u201CNatural\u201D synonymous with indices of Counting, what could be more ex-
orbitant \u2013 etymologically, more \u201Coff the beaten path\u201D \u2013 than basing Number, instead, on
the \u201CXOR bit-dance\u201D implicit in strings of binary toggle-switches? The notion of Zero
was unknown to the Greeks, among whom Number Theory first flourished. It reached the
West from China, via India, then Arabic North Africa, at the dawn of the Italian Renais-
sance, where the powerful utility of its \u201Cplace-holder\u201D thinking (especially when com-
pared to the clunkiness of Roman-numeral manipulations) impressed the new breed of
double-entry bookkeeping-savvy accountants \u2013 in particular, Leonardo of Pisa, son of an
Algerian trading post's director, best known by his nickname, Fibonacci. His Book of the
Abacus of 1202 introduced Hindu-Arabic computation, applying it to many concrete
situations (one of which, involving penned rabbits, led to the series since named for him).
        In his later, deeper but less famous Book of Squares, Fibonacci proved himself the
greatest Number Theorist between Diophantus of mid-3rd Century Alexandria and Pierre
de Fermat of 17th Century France. In particular, his extension of classical results concern-
ing Pythagorean triplets (integer sides of right triangles) led the way toward 3 great mod-
ern insights. First, Hilbert's generalization of what a metric is, in a geometry exceeding
(in a manner even more extreme than Descartes' algebraization anticipated) the 3-D limits
of Greek thinking: its summing an infinite number of squares (mediated by coordinates-
based right triangles), to yield one more (the square of the \u201Cdistance\u201D), is the bedrock of
classical Quantum Mechanics (QM). Second, by positing the uniqueness of squaring (as
opposed to cubing or other empowering) of integer trios, in the manner of the formula
ascribed to (but much older than) Pythagoras, Fermat's Last Theorem of 1630 presented
mathematicians with their most profound (yet simply statable) conundrum \u2013 one which
would trigger momentous developments like Kummer's theory of ideals, and serve (up
through the work of Andrew Wiles) as a guide to pure research for some four centuries.
But third, the number theoretics epitomized by Fibonacci's study of triplets finally ran
aground, in Hurwitz's Proof a century ago, when attempts to assimilate the second, \u201Ccal-
endrical\u201D sense of Number as Cycle, to the \u201Clinear\u201D notion based on Counting, came unra-
veled \u2013 when generalizations, that is, of the angular sense of exponentiation, typifying
Imaginary numbers in 2-D, broke down at last with their third dimension-doubling, by the
Cayley-Dickson Process (CDP), to the 16-D Sedenions . . . where the notion of
\u201Cdistance\u201D itself begins to totter, and Zero-Divisors appear \u201Cout of nowhere.\u201D

R. de Marrais                             Page 2                  \u201CPresto! Digitization: I\u201D
\u000C         In the domain of pure Number, the failure of metrics and emergence of zero-divi-
sors (ZD\u2019s) are joined together, but have their own flavors. There is a progressive break-
down of other properties at each dimension-doubling: the multiplicity of \u201Csheets\u201D associ-
ated by Riemann with equations over fields of Imaginary Number (a \u201Cparking garage\u201D
with infinite levels for functions as fundamental as the logarithmic) is the immediate side-
effect of angular exponents, since there will always be an infinite number of angles with
the same value but different \u201Cwinding number\u201D (just add + 2\u03C0k, k any integer, to the
exponent's \u201Cangle\u201D). In the 4-D Quaternions, we lose commutativity; with the 8-D Octo-
nions, we still have a \u201Cfield,\u201D but it's no longer associative. With each of these losses of
structure, however, there are clear-cut gains in sensitivity: when equations are permitted
to have Complex solutions, the fundamental theorem of algebra \u2013 linking precisely N (not
necessarily distinct) solutions or \u201CZero's\u201D with any Nth order polynomial \u2013 becomes al-
most trivial. With Quaternions, the vector calculus of \u201Cdot\u201D and \u201Ccross\u201D products Gibbs
extracted from them makes the intricacies of physical mechanics simple enough for col-
lege freshmen \u2013 with the \u201Cfull Quaternion,\u201D meanwhile, serving to underwrite QM's angu-
lar momentum operators and Uncertainty relations, as well as the first nonlinear (and
\u201Cnon-Abelian,\u201D hence at least Quaternionic) gauge theories.
         The 16-D loss of a metric has its benefits as well: I'll argue that, in fact, it pro-
vides the \u201Cnatural\u201D context within which we can think about the basic intuition of \u201Csmall-
world\u201D networks, wherein the \u201Cstrength of weak ties\u201D2 is paramount: for here, the key is
gauging relations not of kinship, but acquaintance \u2013\u201Csix degrees of Kevin Bacon,\u201D not
closed systems of blood relationship. Hence, if \u201C~\u201D means \u201Cis acquainted with,\u201D we must
expect that if A ~ B and B ~ C, then C ~ A in general does not obtain, which is to say the
basis of a job-hunter's \u201Cnetworking\u201D does not conform to a standard metric. The metrifi-
cation of 2N-ions, N < 4, is the straightforward result of their all deploying generalized
\u201CPythagorean squares\u201D patterns: writing an arbitrary complex number as z = a + bi, and
another as z* = c + di, we take it for granted that the product of their absolute values is
the absolute value of their products (i.e., it \u201Chas a norm\u201D); alternatively, writing things out
in terms of components, we get an extended sort of Pythagorean relationship between
squares: the product of one sum of N squares by another is a sum of N squares as well,
with N = 2, 4, or 8, for Complex, Quaternionic, or Octonionic Numbers respectively. In
the Complex case, this just means (ac \u2013 bd)2 + (ad + bc)2 = (a2 + b2)(c2 + d2).
         What Hurwitz showed in 1898 is that such patterns no longer work for N > 8. If,
using Rajwade's shorthand,3 we rewrite the rules just given to have form (N, N, N), where
the first two N's stand for the number of squares in the multiplied terms, and the final N
for those in their product, then the Sedenions conform \u201Cat worst\u201D to the rule (16, 16, 32):
since 16 = 8 + 8, apply the Octonions' \u201C8-squares\u201D rule 4 times. (\u201CAt worst\u201D means the
final index in parentheses, at the time Rajwade was writing, may be < 32, although it was
known at the time to be at least 29.) Indefinite redoubling yields a \u201Cworst case\u201D rule (and
harbinger of infinite-dimensional ZD \u201Cmeta-fractals\u201D we\u2019ll call \u201Cskies\u201D) for 2N-ions, N =
(3 + k) > 4: (2N, 2N, 2N + k). This is a side-effect of \u201CBott periodicity,\u201D an 8-D modularity
found in countless arenas (e.g., Clifford algebras and cobordism theories) since Raoul
Bott first displayed it in more limited topological contexts. The keyword is modularity:
for ZD\u2019s arise simply in ring theory as soon as we consider finite rings, over integer do-
mains made from composites, not primes. Consider the integers modulo 6: 1 + 5 = 2 + 4
= 3 + 3 = 0, but 2 * 3 = 0 as well, making 2 and 3 \u201Cmutual ZD's\u201D in this context.

R. de Marrais                              Page 3                   \u201CPresto! Digitization: I\u201D
\u000C         It was hardly obvious, though, that ZD's were an inevitable side-effect of the mod-
ularity of angular exponents. Gauss himself had assumed the Imaginary realm was the
\u201Cshadow of shadows\u201D of an infinite hierarchy of higher entities. (The \u201Ccomposite\u201D cha-
racter \u2013 not of 2N-ions for some high N, but of Complex Numbers themselves \u2013 was a
shock. Kummer's theory of ideals arose in response to the collapse of his \u201Cproof\u201D of Fer-
mat's Last Theorem, which foundered on the non-unique nature of decomposing Complex
\u201Cnumber rings\u201D into prime factors.) When plausible extensions of the Imaginary were
found to occur only in 2N dimensions, and \u2013 as Hamilton first showed with the failure of
the commutative law among Quaternions \u2013 further displayed surprising losses of just
those behaviors thought indispensable to any sane notion of Number, the suspicion that
things were not so simple as Gauss had supposed started growing, and eventually was
confirmed by Hurwitz \u2013 after which, CDP-generated hypercomplex numbers were dis-
carded as \u201Cpathological.\u201D (A situation highly reminiscent of that which Benoit Mandel-
brot found in analysis, whose \u201Cmonsters\u201D he turned into the \u201Cpets\u201D we now call \u201Cfractals.\u201D
The connection between these, meanwhile, and the XOR-based \u201Ccarry-bit overflow\u201D that
characterizes progressive derivations of 2N-ions by CDP, will provide the bridge we need
between ZD's and \u201Cscale-free\u201D \u2013 i.e., \u201Cfractal power-law\u201D \u2013 networks.)
         And so the situation remained for exactly a century, until Guillermo Moreno's
1998 paper4 indicated ZD's conformed to some remarkably simple patterns (they span a
subspace of the Sedenions homomorphic to G2, the Octonions' automorphism group \u2013 a
result extensible, in turn, to all higher Number forms derived by CDP, since G2 was
known already to be the general 2N-ions' \u201Cderivation algebra\u201D from 2N-1-ions). The dis-
covery, 2 years later, that ZD's obeyed rules of engagement most cleary displayed in the
workings of XOR relations between bit-strings \u2013 that is, by an NKS, not classical, sense
of what Number is \u2013 marked the first results of my own research. (In a twisted echo of N-
squares norms, we'll find our \u201Cmaster key\u201D in this: the index of the product of two 2N-
ions is the XOR of their indices!) But the hundred years between Hurwitz and the new
interest in the \u201Cmetric-free\u201D ways of ZD's didn't see the problem dismissed so much as
displaced. As my argument hinges on this displacement, let's give it a special name.
         L\u00E9vi-Strauss has famously compared the structures of Baroque and Classical mu-
sic to those his analyses found in North and South American mythologies, explaining this
correspondence as a kind of \"reincarnation.\"5 As the advent of printing presses and print-
specific modes of rational expression (viz., novels) replaced mythic narrative, the struc-
tures of the latter were reborn in new forms, in the \"well-tempered'\" modes of music we
associate with names like J. S. Bach, Haydn, and Mozart. With the advent of communica-
tions technology and electronic modes of broadcasting and conversing, a similar (but
oppositely directed) \"reincarnation\" can be indicated: the program killed by Hurwitz's
proof in mathematics is reborn, ensouled in the new body of structural linguistics.
         The genealogical derivation of Number Forms via CDP \u2013 which, starting with the
Real\u2019s fourth generation of \u201Cancestor doubling\u201D collectively dubbed Sedenions, seemed to
become fatally overrun with \"monstrosities\" \u2013 was paralleled, in work contemporary with
Hurwitz's (and the ultimate source of L\u00E9vi-Strauss's), by the beginnings of de Saussure's
structural analysis of linguistic signs. This quickly led to Louis Hjelmslev's \"Net\" of
indefinitely many strata, each housing a bifurcation into \"form\" and \"substance\" dichoto-
mies (etic vs emic, as in \"phonetic\" vs \"phonemic\"), later given a name in its own right by
Andr\u00E9 Martinet: the indefinitely extensible process of \"double articulation.\"6

R. de Marrais                             Page 4                  \u201CPresto! Digitization: I\u201D
\u000C1. Hjelmslev's Net and Box-Kite Basics
        The semantic sieving by binaries called \u201CHjelmslev's Net,\u201D \u201Cwhose minimal num-
ber\u201D of successive distinctions \u201Cguarantees their maximal extension,\u201D starts with a split
into identically defined, arbitrarily named categories of expression line and content line
which \u201Chave mutual solidarity through the sign function.\u201D7 Deleuze and Guattari depict
this cascade of \u201Creciprocal presuppositions\u201D (Roman Jakobson's term for it) this way:

       Now this net had the advantage of breaking with the form-content duality,
       since there was a form of content no less than a form of expression.
       Hjelmslev's enemies saw this merely as a way of rebaptizing the discredit-
       ed notions of the signified and signifier, but something quite different was
       actually going on. Despite what Hjelmslev himself may have said, the net
       is not linguistic in scope or origin (the same must be said of double articu-
       lation: if language has a specificity of its own, as it most certainly does,
       that specificity consists neither in double articulation nor in Hjelmslev's
       net, which are general characteristics of the strata).8

         From here, the \u201Cstructural semantics\u201D of Algirdas Greimas' \u201CSemiotic Square\u201D will
show us how to link Catastrophe Theory to the foundations of semantics via ZD \u201Crepre-
sentations,\u201D with an assist from the researches of Jean Petitot, disciple of Greimas and
Ren\u00E9 Thom both. But for those familiar with Deleuze's other writings, something of the
sort is already implicit in the quote above: for the term \u201Cstrata\u201D is in fact inspired by
Catastrophists' special use of it, and as such was the focus of an earlier work on Leibniz,
named after the simplest Catastrophe, The Fold. (And cited at length in numerous places
germane to our interests, by Petitot.9 Recall, too, it was Leibniz who adapted the ancient
Chinese scheme of \u201Csolid\u201D and \u201Cbroken\u201D lines, in the 26 hexagrams of the I Ching, seed-
ing all later ideas of binary bit-strings!) This is made explicit in the authors' introduction
to \u201Cdouble articulation\u201D:

       God is a Lobster, or a double pincer, a double bind. Not only do strata
       come in at least pairs, but in a different way each stratum is double (it it-
       self has several layers). Each stratum exhibits phenomena constitutive of
       double articulation. Articulate twice, B-A, BA. This is not at all to say
       that the strata speak or are language based. Double articulation is so ex-
       tremely variable that we cannot begin with a general model, only a
       relatively simple case. The first articulation chooses or deducts, from un-
       stable particle-flows, metastable molecular or quasi-molecular units (sub-
       stances) upon which it imposes a statistical order of connections and
       successions (forms). The second articulation establishes functional, com-
       pact, stable structures (forms), and constructs the molar compounds in
       which these structures are simultaneously actualized (substances). In a
       geological stratum, for example, the first articulation is the process of
       \u201Csedimentation,\u201D which deposits units of cyclic sediment according to a
       statistical order: flysch, with its succession of sandstone and schist. The
       second articulation is the \u201Cfolding\u201D that sets up a stable functional
       structure and effects the passage from sediment to sedimentary rock.10

\u000C         But how might ZD's relate to Catastrophes? Consider, first, in Catastrophe Theo-
ry, the simplest \u201Ccompact\u201D unfolding of a Singularity (meaning, no \u201Ctune in next time\u201D
sendings to or from \u201Cinfinity\u201D\u2013 i.e., beyond the model\u2019s \u201Clocal scoping\u201D) entails the split-
ting of a stable regime, or \u201Cattractor,\u201D into two. These may compete until capture of one
by the other, and exhibit paradoxical interplay en route (e.g., the \u201Cgirl playing hard to get\u201D
surrendering when her suitor gives up, or the \u201Crat backed into a corner\u201D jumping the
cat).11 But simply reverse the sign on the potential function which defines the \u201Cbehavior\u201D
associated with twiddling this Cusp's two \u201Ccontrols,\u201D and we get a \u201CDual Cusp,\u201D with two
unstable maxima (\u201Cmountain peaks\u201D or \u201Cfountains,\u201D not \u201Cbasins of attraction\u201D), mediated
by a solitary zone of stability (instead of a compromise-inhibiting \u201Czone of inaccessibili-
ty,\u201D necessitating the standard Cusp's trademark \u201Cjump\u201D). This is the dynamics of a pan-
balance, which seesaws until the weights on its two arms are in equilibrium (a \u201Cmeasure-
ment\u201D is obtained). Similarly, when two non-zero quantities have a Zero product, this
result can be interpreted in the manner of \u201Cpair production\u201D from the far-from-empty QM
Void. In ZD's generated by CDP, a zero product of 2 of them isn\u2019t just \u201Cnothing,\u201D but a
pair of oppositely signed copies of a 3rd ZD, which always zero-divides the first 2's
\u201Cdiagonal twins\u201D (see next paragraph). If we use \u201C~\u201D to write \u201Cmutually zero-divides,\u201D we
can define an equivalence relation, peculiar to ZD's, upon which we'll construct an NKS
substitute for \u201CPythagorean triplets\u201D (actually, \u201Csix-packs\u201D) using letters A \u2013 F.
         To preface a longer story with some shorthand, the letters stand for vertices of
special kinds of triangles, called Sails. Each letter further denotes a plane (\u201CAssessor\u201D)
spanned by two imaginary axes, whose diagonals are saturated with (and in fact contain
all the \u201Cprimitive\u201D) ZD's. 4 such Sails, joined only at 6 shared vertices, comprise half the
faces of an Octahedral vertex figure, or \u201CBox-Kite\u201D \u2013 a 3-D iconic shorthand for the 12-D
space ZD\u2019s really span! Its 4 \u201Cempty\u201D triangles are Vents where \u201C2N-ion winds\u201D blow. If
we arbitrarily label one Sail\u2019s vertices A, B, C, and those of its opposite Vent F, E, D re-
spectively, then the 3 orthogonal lines AF, BE and CD demarcate \u201CStruts\u201D: stabilizing
dowels made of wood or plastic in real-world Box-Kites.12 For all and only the vertex
pairs at opposite ends of a Strut, mutual ZD's don't exist. Along all 12 edges of the Box-
Kite, however, the \u201C~\u201D relation obtains between vertices, and indicates a binary selection
rule: if the edge is marked with a plus sign (\u201C+\u201D) on the Box-Kite, then similarly oriented
diagonals at each vertex \u2013 both passing through the same 2 quadrants of their respective
planes (\u201C/\u201D for the {\u2013 \u2013, ++} or \u201Csynchronized\u201D13 line; \u201C\\\u201D for the \u201Canti-synchronized\u201D or
{\u2013 +, + \u2013} line) \u2013 are mutual ZD's . If marked with a minus sign (\u201C\u2013\u201D), however, the
reverse obtains: a slash (\u201C/\u201D) at either vertex mutually ZD's the other's backslash (\u201C\\\u201D).
         It is an invariant feature of Box-Kites that one Sail will have all 3 edges marked
\u201C\u2013\u201D, with its opposite Vent likewise having 3 \u201C\u2013\u201D edge-signs, while all 6 remaining edges
are marked \u201C+\u201D. By convention, the all-minus Sail, dubbed the \u201CZigzag,\u201D is labeled A, B,
C, making the all-minus Vent F, E, D. The Zigzag gets its name from contemplating the
sequence of diagonals joined in ZD pairings as one circuits its vertices: if we start with a
\u201C/,\u201D then we get a 6-cyclic \u201Cdouble covering\u201D of this sort: \u201C/ \\ / \\ / \\\u201D. The other 3 Sails,
with 2 \u201C+\u201D edges and 1 \u201C\u2013\u201D, do a double-circuit that suggests the under-over tracings of
the knots they're named for: Trefoils (\u201C/ / / \\ \\ \\\u201D). The \u201C3 + 1\u201D logic of Trefoils vs Zigzag
will be seen to play a fundamental role in semantic models. To understand it, though, we
must now show where the XOR-ing of integer indices comes into play between edge- and
strut- joined vertices, and within the pairs of axial units forming planes at each.

\u000C         From an infinity of regular forms in low dimension (e.g., \u201Cpolygons\u201D), only tri-
angles and squares generalize to N-space (ergo, simplexes and \u201CCartesian coordinates\u201D).
Likewise, while there are many ways to represent \"multiplication tables\" of hypercomplex
numbers (2 for Quaternions: ij = k or ik = j; 480 for Octonions, labeled via 7 nodes and 7
arrows on the PSL(2,7) triangle; 100\u2019s of billions for Sedenions), only one scheme works
consistently, without anomalies, for all CDP 2N-ions. Index all 2N units by integers, from
0 (for \"reals\") to 2N \u2013 1 (hence, up to 15 for Sedenions). The product of 2 such will have
as its index the XOR of the indices of the units producing it. A Sedenion \u201Cfor instance\u201D
is found in the triplet (7, 12, 11): that is, i7 * i12 = i[7 XOR 12] = i11.
         Signing of products is more involved; in fact, the anomalies it inevitably engen-
ders are what make ZD\u2019s possible! Signing is simple in one crucial instance: \u201Cadding a
bit to the left\u201D to 2N-ions\u2019 indices effectively multiplies them \u201Cfrom the right,\u201D by the unit
indexed 2N \u2013 thereby generating 2N+1-ions. 2N hence is the \u201Cgenerator\u201D (henceforth, G) for
the 2N+1-ions; within the latter, index XORing tells us that for k < G, ik * iG = + i(k + G) , and
oppositely for k > G. For all other indices, associative triplets (i.e., clones of Quaterni-
ons, or \u201CQ-copies,\u201D with 7 in the Octonions, 35 in the Sedenions, and (2N \u2013 1)(2N \u2013 2)/6
for general 2N-ions) display conflicts between \u201Csigning\u201D and \u201Ccounting\u201D order. This is
due to the \u201CNKS effect\u201D of iteratively adding bits via successive \u201CG actions,\u201D N growing.
In an XOR-compliant writing of Octonion triplets, if the first 2 indices are in the order
that generates a \u201C+\u201D sign for the 3rd, then (1, 2, 3) \u2013 \u201Ci, j, k\u201D indices for standard Quater-
nions \u2013 have \u201Csign ordering\u201D identical to \u201Ccounting order\u201D as shown; ditto, for (1, 4, 5);
(2, 4, 6); (2, 5, 7); and (3, 4, 7). But the 2 remaining triplets, if written to show \u201Csign
ordering,\u201D must necessarily violate \u201Ccounting order\u201D: (1, 7, 6) and (3, 6, 5). And while it
is possible to fiddle with labeling schemes to reduce the number of such \u201Cout-of-sync\u201D
triplets to 1, one can never expunge them entirely: there is always a bump in the rug.
And, starting with the Sedenions (viz., the (7, 12, 11) triplet cited last paragraph), such
bumps will clash in such a manner as to mandate the existence of Zero-Divisors.
         Corollarily, such ZD's will never involve products including the perfectly behaved
G. This leads to a surprisingly simple rule for finding all the \u201Cprimitive\u201D ZD's in the Se-
denions: take one unit whose index, L, is less than G, then take another whose index U
exceeds it, and does not equal the XOR of G with L (equivalent to saying, in this special
case, it doesn't equal G + L). For any of the 7 choices of L, there are then 6 choices left
for U, such that the plane they span (one of the 7 * 6 = 42 \u201CAssessors\u201D) will have diago-
nals of the form k * ( iL + iU ), k real, all of whose points are ZD's. Put another way, point
coordinates on these lines (hence, k values) are irrelevant, ergo arbitrary: ZD's are there-
fore best thought of as line elements \u2013 meaning they, like NKS entities generally, as Wol-
fram has argued the case, have an inherent randomness built into their workings.14
         This rule (with restrictions due to \u201Ccarry-bit overflow\u201D) generalizes for higher 2N-
ions; the point of moment, for present purposes, is that Sedenions partition into 7 Box-
Kites, each housing 6 Assessors, each of which forms ZD's only within the 2 Sails sharing
its vertex in its Box-Kite. This is the concrete manifestation of Moreno's abstract \u201CG2
homomorphism\u201D: since G2 symmetry is either 14-fold (when the subscripted \u201C2\u201D \u2013 for the
count of unit vectors spanning the space containing its dozen \u201Croots\u201D \u2013 is included, as
when particle physicists calculate symmetries), or 12-fold (as in coding theory or kaleido-
scope building), the simplest homomorphism to contain both possibilities has an 84 count
\u2013 the number, precisely, of ZD-saturated lines, when tallying across all 7 Box-Kites.15

\u000C2. \u201CGreimas's Glitch\u201D and the ZD-Net Hypothesis
        Although this may seem like reaching on a first reading, the last few paragraphs
set up the second resonance between ZD's and the fundaments of semantics. The first, of
course, was the suggestive analogy between the nonstop redoubling of Hjelmslev's Net
and the Cayley-Dickson Process. The second, though, is readily made by those who
know what to look for: for the dyadic nature of ZD's \u2013 each comprised of two indecom-
posable \u201Cunits,\u201D one with index less than the generator G, one with index greater, which
is a formal way of saying they inhere in different analytic \u201Clevels\u201D\u2013 is just what Algirdas
Greimas tells us is called for to resolve the most deep-set contradiction in the classical
structuralist agenda. \u201CGreimas's Glitch,\u201D as I like to think of it, can be depicted thus.
        Once upon a time, there was a fundamental epistemological problem in Saussur-
ean signification theory. It was celebrated in all its na\u00EFvet\u00E9 on the cover of the Winter '72
issue of the postmodernist review Diacritics, which displayed a picture of the wrapper
from a then-new candy from Peter Paul, a peanut-butter bar called \u201CNo Jelly.\u201D This was
meant to be juxtaposed with a lift from a text of near-scriptural status, Ferdinand de Saus-
sure's Course in General Linguistics, printed on the inner back cover: \u201CIn language there
are only differences. Even more important: a difference generally implies positive terms
between which the difference is set up; but in language there are only differences without
positive terms.\u201D (This number became famous for other reasons, too: it contained the
first major English interview with deconstructionist Jacques Derrida \u2013 one of whose prin-
cipal targets, of course, was the ensemble of de Saussure's unexamined assumptions!)
        The credo of pure arbitrariness in signs (any random signifier could, in theory, be
linked to any random signified) meant their patterns of mutual difference alone made sig-
nifying thinkable \u2013 which made the existence of synonyms and their generalizations a
problem. Greimas used the \"double articulation\" agenda initiated by Hjelmslev to posit a
way out of this embarrassment: assume two \"pieces\" of a signifying complex reside at
different strata, so that they essentially could work together when combined with another
such complex to yield a \"zero\" (hence, synonym effect) in semantic difference. (Think
non-message bits in a self-correcting error code.) This point is too far-reaching not to in-
stantiate it: in Structural Semantics, Greimas gives as example the \u201Csynonymous\u201D mor-
phological marks \u201C-s\u201D and \u201C-en,\u201D for designating plurals (\u201Ccows\u201D vs \u201Coxen\u201D) in English.
These different marks can cover identical elements of content, \u201Con the condition, how-
ever, of having different contextual distributions.\u201D

       It is consequently sufficient that a mark be realized twice, at two different
       structural levels \u2013 the first time under the form of the opposition of phon-
       emes, the second time, under the form of the opposition of phonematic
       segments \u2013 for the differentiating effect of the first mark to be canceled by
       the advent of the second differential gap. Thus in some conditions two
       marks can be neutralized by combining with each other:

                                      X+(\u2013X)=0

       and redundant variation on the plane of expression does not provoke any
       difference of signification. Thus synonymy is possible.16


R. de Marrais                              Page 8                  \u201CPresto! Digitization: I\u201D
\u000C         Thus, whatever other significances we may attribute to it, Zero here indicates a
state of \u201Cno difference\u201D between semantic contents, and hence a redundancy which con-
text may frame as lack or ambiguity of meaning, but which change of context may con-
vert into a bifurcation of possibly intended senses, as with puns, jokes, and ironic state-
ments \u2013 with the affect responses these can induce being minimally modeled by standard
Cusps (whose nonlinear \u201Cjumps\u201D in such cases, between the attractors competing to be
\u201Ctaken seriously\u201D by us, are frequently flagged by sudden bursts of laughter).17
         Primitively speaking, potential meaning is linked with potential for affect release
\u2013 the \u201CAha!\u201D experience, that is, contains the gist of \u201Cmaking sense.\u201D But we also know
two other things. First, \u201Clevel-jumping\u201D is indigenous not just to specific \u201Cmeaning expe-
riences,\u201D but has a volatility independent of any such instances, which allows us to navi-
gate between \u201Ccandidates\u201D for meaningfulness with a freedom verging on infinite: in a
slogan, anything can be quoted or pointed at (\u201CThat!\u201D). Such pronominal \u201Cpointing\u201D
serves precisely to fulfill its own name: any phenomenon, however complex and hence
needful of enormous numbers of dimensions to be modeled, can be magically shrunk to a
point \u2013 with the reverse mountain-from-molehill process, of course, obtaining (\u201Cpoint
well taken!\u201D) just as naturally. Derrida calls this \u201Citerability,\u201D noting that \u201CEvery sign,
linguistic or nonlinguistic\u201D is amenable to citing/sighting/siting/inciting us to insight:
\u201CThis citationality, duplication, or duplicity, this iterability of the mark,\u201D he tells us, \u201Cis
not an accident or anomaly, but is that (normal/abnormal) without which a mark could no
longer even have a so-called 'normal' functioning.\u201D18
         What this means for our ambitions here is that our modeling must have built-in
\u201Copen-ended-ness,\u201D with the indefinite extensibility of 2N-ions as its vehicle. We will
ultimately need means for collapsing high-order ensembles into \u201Cpoints\u201D \u2013 and not just
means, but motives: there must, that is, be mechanisms indigenous to our models which
enable \u201Cexplosions\u201D of insight-flashes into epics. (Poincar\u00E9 puts his foot on the bus, and
sees in a flash how his Fuchsian groups\u2019 transformations can \u201Cprovide transportation\u201D for
hyperbolic geometry as well!)19 Before we can even consider what that might require,
however, let\u2019s note that its fulfillment must contradict the basic assumptions which but-
tress up our choice of where to start from \u2013 which leads me to the second \u201Cother thing\u201D
referenced in the paragraph before the citation. 2N-ions offer us structural alternatives
extending far beyond the limits of \u201CBott periodicity\u201D; but the Catastrophist\u2019s toolkit is
\u201Clocal\u201D in the extreme, with the \u201Celementary\u201D theory being heavily constrained by the 8-D
\u201CBott limit\u201D: \u201Cnew tricks\u201D stop with the 8-D end of the 3-term E series of singularities.
         A famous conundrum, in fact, with implications for all finite mathematical classi-
fications, had its origins in this very domain. I refer to Vladimir Arnol\u2019d\u2019s 1972 \u201CA, D, E
Problem,\u201D20 which showed the taxonomy of local singularities Catastrophes provide in
fact complies, at a meta-level, with countless other schemes, shorthanded by the \u201Cball-
and-stick\u201D drawings physicists call \u201CDynkin Diagrams,\u201D and algebraists interested in fi-
nite reflection groups (a.k.a. kaleidoscopes) know by Coxeter\u2019s name. In this setting, the
trivial accelerated object in a gravitational potential, the simple Fold of sudden starts and
ends, the doubly complex (but still quite simple) Cusp, are just the three lowest forms on
the infinite \u201Ctotem pole\u201D of \u201CAn\u201D type, with n = 1, 2, 3 respectively. But as the guy paint-
ing the street meridian put it in \u201CChafed Elbows,\u201D \u201CYou have to draw the line someplace\u201D
\u2013 and this will be where we draw ours to start with. (Merging this \u201Cstarter kit\u201D into NT\u2019s
fractal \u201CBig Picture\u201D will concern us later \u2013 and indeed, is a key target.)

R. de Marrais                              Page 9                   \u201CPresto! Digitization: I\u201D
\u000C        Let\u2019s start, then, by noting that if Zero-Divisors can indeed serve as markers to
indicate a lack of difference (or, dually, an ambiguous \u201Cbalancing act\u201D) between two
meanings, in what manner can they facilitate a basis for locking a meaning in place?
Corollarily, if simple Catastrophe models can underwrite simple \u201Cmeaning effects,\u201D in
what sense do ZD\u2019s and these models intersect? As a first pass at an answer, let\u2019s posit
the following five-step \u201CZD-Net Hypothesis\u201D:

   1. Since ZD\u2019s seem, in some primary way, to facilitate synonymy (and hence inhibit
      individuation of significance), the most fundamental \"meaning effects\" should de-
      volve upon just those substructures of ZD ensembles \u2013 \u201CSails\u201D and \"Box-Kites\"
      and (starting with the 32-D Pathions) multiple-Box-Kite synergies \u2013 wherein ZD\u2019s
      are not acting \u201Cas such.\u201D
   2. The most basic ZD objects which don\u2019t act as such are \"Strut-opposites\": only
      oppositely placed Assessors on a Box-Kite do not mutually zero-divide, and their
      4 units obey an \"XOR arithmetic\" equivalent to the logic of Greimas' \"Semiotic
      Square\" (SS). As Petitot makes the case that the SS, a fundamental \u201Ccrossing\u201D of
      two semantic polarities, can be approached as the simplest \u201Cstacking\u201D interaction
      of two simple 2-Control Cusps (which is to say, in terms of the fifth term and its
      dual in the A series, one simple 4-Control Butterfly), this implies the standard and
      dual A5 can be \u201Crepresented\u201D by \u201CStrut logic,\u201D with the horizontal, diagonal and
      vertical paths on the SS corresponding to its invariant features (Strut Constant
      \u201CS,\u201D Generator \u201CG\u201D, and their XOR \u201CX\u201D, not necessarily in that order).
   3. Sails contain substructures which are not zero-divisors: the \u201CL\u201D units (indices <
      G) of each Assessor in a Sail form a Q-copy; but each also forms a Q-copy with
      the \u201CU\u201D units (indices > G) of its two \u201CSailing partners.\u201D For the Zigzag ABC, we
      can write these this way: {a, b, c}; {a, B, C}; {A, b, C}; {A, B, c}. The same ob-
      tains for Trefoils, but the subtle \u201CTrip Sync\u201D property says that \u201Cbow-tie flows\u201D
      (akin to Greimas\u2019 \u201Cfigure-8\u2019s\u201D) through their shared Assessor, from one Zigzag Q-
      copy to another in a Trefoil, allow for a special kind of D-series \u201Cmessage pas-
      sing.\u201D This process also permits an interpretation of a second SS reading, favored
      by American postmodernists, and (due to his claiming an isomorphism between
      his Square and the Klein Group) sanctioned by Greimas himself.
   4. The eliciting of Tests and Helpers and their interrelationships are the hallmark of
      Greimas\u2019 analysis of Vladimir Propp\u2019s study of Russian wondertales (the study
      from which the SS construct emerged). As Greimas points out, there are 3 of each
      in any such tales\u2019 architecture, and this can be related to the 3 Struts (and 3 \u201CTrip
      Sync\u201D message-pass setups, one per Trefoil) in a Box-Kite. The \u201Ccontract,\u201D mean-
      while, which enables the tale as a whole, can be associated with the ZD-free Q-
      copy with units indexed by S, G, X and 0 (the real unit) \u2013 what a C++ or Java pro-
      grammer would call an \u201Cabstract class,\u201D which the tale\u2019s unfolding instantiates.
   5. The simplest CT object which incorporates all the above is also the simplest \u201Cnon-
      elementary\u201D Catastrophic form \u2013 one rigorously related by Arnol\u2019d\u2019s school to the
      Equilateral among the 3 \u201Cprimordial triangles\u201D in Plato\u2019s Timaeus.21 (The other 2
      underwrite \u201Chigher harmonics\u201D of Box-Kite representation, thanks to which the
      pathway to NT embeddings via higher 2N-ion cascading is opened to our inquiry.)

\u000C3. Semiotic Squares and \u201CEco Echo\u201D
        The Italian writer Umberto Eco is best known for his novels \u2013 one of which, The
Name of the Rose, was made into a highly successful Sean Connery vehicle. But he is
also a major European academic, and one of the world\u2019s pre-eminent semioticians. In his
best-known scholarly text, he\u2019s noted a fundamental difficulty in the enterprise of nailing
down the \u201Cbasics\u201D of what meaning is, which will be referenced herein as \u201CEco echo\u201D:

       as soon as the semantic universals are reduced in number and made more
       comprehensive \u2026 they become unable to mark the difference between
       different sememes. And as soon as their number is augmented and their
       capacity for individuation grows, they become ad hoc definitions\u2026. The
       real problem is that every semantic unit used in order to analyze a sememe
       is in its turn a sememe to be analyzed.22

        The problem is rendered far less paradoxical by seeing semantics as side-effect of
a mathematical substrate (one of the primary motivations for representing fields of know-
ledge as mathematical \u201Csciences\u201D in the first place!). Yet \u201CEco echo\u201D still has a residuum
of \u201CCheshire cat\u2019s smile\u201D adhering to it, which must be somehow addressed in the mathe-
matical apparatus we put in place. Complementary to Derrida\u2019s \u201Citerability,\u201D \u201CEco echo-
ing\u201D requires that we at least treat the 3 distinct binary categories of relationship which
constitute the Semiotic Square as having a protean nature, which double articulation can
underwrite (and find, within this process, its own impetus). Relations represented by SS
verticals (perhaps strut-constant \u201CS\u201D values in Box-Kite talk) can, in other SS\u2019s serving
other purposes, appear as horizontals (hence, G xor S = G + S = \u201CX\u201D values), or even as
diagonals (generators themselves, once \u201Crelabeling schemes\u201D are allowed) in others.
        Allied with such conversions are fundamental patterns of \u201Cexplosion,\u201D the simp-
lest of which show how G, S, and X patterns among Sedenion Box-Kites can be mapped
to ensemble effects in the 32-D Pathions\u2019 various septets (7 \u201CPl\u00E9iades\u201D plus the \u201CAtlas\u201D or
\u201CMuster Master\u201D) and triads (the 7 \u201Csand mandalas\u201D) of Box-Kites \u2013 which we\u2019ll express
as special \u201Cblow-ups\u201D along S, G and X pathways, with each having its own somewhat
surprising properties. As the aim here is to be illustrative rather than exhaustive, we\u2019ll be
providing exemplifications of patterns amenable to greater generalization, rather than
anything like an \u201Caxiomatics.\u201D (We will later, when we speak of higher-order \u201Csemical
harmonics\u201D of Box-Kite representational analysis, consider ways in which SS\u2019s them-
selves can be seen as \u201Clines\u201D within \u201Cmeta-SS\u201D diagrams \u2013 but again, our aim will be to
introduce, not exhaust, such topics, which are after all still in their infancy as research
themes, yet should be taken as candidates for indefinite induction anyway.)
        This much said, some \u201Cbuffer refresh,\u201D via a new Box-Kite diagram and ancillary
tables of index patterns, is next, with attention directed initially to peculiarities obtaining
between Strut-Opposite dyads (as well as between the diagonals within a single Assessor
at either end of such a dyad). In the diagram, uppercase demarcates indices > G; lower-
case, those less. A, B, C mark the Zigzag (on top), and D, E, F the Vent opposite it, with
the negative edge-signs framing them drawn in red ink to make a Star of David (with the
outer hexagon of positive edge-signs in blue). Zigzag ABC, and Trefoils ADE, FDB and
FCE, are painted moon-silver, blood-red, sun-yellow and sky-blue, respectively.

         Note that, in this way of rendering the Box-Kite, the products of the lowercase
letters joining vertices along the outer blue hexagon have sign-orders that are always
positive when tracing a counterclockwise path: for strut constant 1, for instance, a*d =
3*4 = + 7, the e at the ADE Trefoil\u2019s 3rd vertex. But now observe that the reverse is the
case for products of UPPERCASE letters along the same paths: A*D = 10*13 = \u20137, the e
with reversed sign this time (e and not E, since the high bits are XOR\u2019d away). For the
edges in red along the Star of David, abc and ABC products are positive along counter-
clockwise pathways, while def and DEF are positive along clockwise. (See BK4 for a
brief explanation and proof.) This is the basis of the \u201CTrip Sync\u201D property alluded to
above: \u201Cslippage\u201D is allowed from one Q-copy to the other sharing a lowercase index if it
belongs to the Zigzag (equivalent to saying, as we\u2019ll be seeing, that exchanges along an X
path in a Semiotic Square are \u201Cfree\u201D). Otherwise, a \u201Cquantum of spin\u201D (or orientation re-
versal) will result. In the uniquely \u201Call red-edged\u201D Zigzag Sail, such slippage is always
unobservable in this context. (The importance of this will become clear once we translate
Strut Opposites\u2019 multiplicative patterns into SS language. \u201CSlip spin\u201D reverses relations 2
Squares share, in a way involving D-series Catastrophes \u2013 with \u201Cmeaning effects\u201D involv-
ing Greimas\u2019 trio of \u201CHelpers,\u201D enabling one SS \u201Chand\u201D to \u201Cwash the other.\u201D)
         A \u201C/\u201D or \u201C\\\u201D times itself, at any vertex, is some scalar times the negative real unit.
The product of \u201C/\u201D and \u201C\\,\u201D in the same Assessor plane, is + a scalar times X ( = G + S).
Next in complexity are Strut-Opposite products: writing (V, v) and (Z, z) for \u201Cdef\u201D Vent
and Zigzag Assessors which straddle a Strut, the rules are just V * Z = v * z = S; Z * v =
V * z = G; Z * z = v * V = X. But to which of the Semiotic Square\u2019s 4 corners (yielding
4! = 24 choices) should each go? And which arrow-types should be labeled G, S and X?
(6 more choices!) Might the answers to these questions depend, to some extent, upon the
specifics you wish to elicit? It would do to describe the 3 path types in classic Jakobson-
Greimas language, then try out a couple of mappings while watching what happens . . .
but first, let\u2019s come at things from the other side of our overriding comparative urge, and
derive the Square\u2019s own context by an iterative process \u2013 CDP-driven \u201Cdouble articula-
tion\u201D of the Reals \u2013 then (per Wolfram\u2019s mantra) \u201Cwatch what happens.\u201D
         To inaugurate that last exercise, an initial setup should suggest itself: the indefi-
nitely extensible morass of ZD\u2019s, caught up in Flows beyond the confines of metrics, can
be thought of as the \u201Csediment\u201D of the first Deleuzian articulation; the Lie-algebraic \u201Cele-
mentary taxonomies\u201D conforming to \u201CA-D-E\u201D diagrams provide the Forms, or \u201Csedimen-
tary rock\u201D of the second. We could call the latter \u201Cbelonging structures,\u201D and the former
\u201Cmeaningful flows\u201D \u2013 carriers of the shapes and colors Hjelmslev\u2019s Net goes fishing for.

\u000C         If you\u2019ve been reading the discursive footnotes (especially 15, and 19-21), or are
familiar with the literature on \u201CA-D-E\u201D already, then you know that this divide between
Forms and Flows is hardly arbitrary. All Forms are positive-curvature bound, which is
how the McKay Correspondence is literally able, by projection from SU(2)\u2019s 4-space to
the 3-D sphere Plato himself knew, to map polygons to the A-series, dihedra (polygons
colored on both sides) to the D, and the E-series to the 3 symmetries underlying the 5
regular solids (with cubes and octahedra, and icosa- and dodeca- hedra, being \u201Cduals\u201D of
each other, such that the vertex figure of either maps to the faces of the other). The \u201Cpri-
mordial triangles\u201D of interest to us, per the fifth part of the ZD-Net Hypothesis, form a
thin \u201Cboundary layer\u201D of \u201Cflat\u201D or \u201CEuclidean\u201D curvature, containing \u2013 in a dimension-
reversing sense topologists should feel at home with \u2013 the 3 Platonic Solids as maximal
strata: the equilateral triangle, the tetrahedron (E6); the right isosceles, the Box-Kite\u2019s
octahedron (E7); the 30-60-90, the icosahedron (with \u201Cclosest packing\u201D of 8D spheres
mapped by Octonionic loops of 240 \u201Cintegral Cayley numbers,\u201D the E8 \u201Croot count\u201D).
         These are also the cross-sections of the 3 prismatic kaleidoscopes one can build
with 3 mirrors (one for each of the \u201CTimaeus\u201D singularities\u2019 behavior variables \u2013 and, in
particular, one for each Strut in our Box-Kite). These singularities are all \u201Cnon-elemen-
tary,\u201D which is to say they have \u201Cparameters\u201D which measure the breakdown of the link
between topology and differentiability \u2013 which mysterious variables, based upon projec-
tive invariants (e.g., perspective\u2019s cross-ratio for the non-Equilaterals), are rendered pal-
pable and even prosaic by prismatic scoping: instead of a single center of symmetry, as in
the standard 6-fold kid\u2019s symmetry-maker, you get honeycombs tessellated by the triangle
in question, with as many centers as your viewing aperture will let you take a peek at.
This \u201Cmodularity\u201D (related, but not identical, to the notion of that name we talked about at
the outset) is linked to certain critical values which, when hit upon, cause \u201Cexplosions\u201D
into infinite-dimensional \u201Ccontrol spaces\u201D \u2013 just the sort of impetus our discussion of
\u201Citerability,\u201D at the start of last section, said we\u2019d be needing.
         But needing for what, exactly? For throwing our Net into the negative-curvature
spaces of higher-dimension reaches, where Chaotic \u201Cperiod-doubling\u201D and other modes of
turbulence hold forth. The non-elementary figures of what Form-like patterns exist there
are all related, as Dolgachev showed, to M. C. Escher\u2019s world of hyperbolic tilings \u2013 and,
as Jacques Hadamard first pointed out in the year of Hurwitz\u2019s Proof, such spaces of
negative curvature are generally divergent (in senses that Poincar\u00E9\u2019s then-ongoing efforts
were just making discussable).23 Add to this, the seemingly gratuitous fact that James
Callahan, in his now-classic multi-dimensional navigations of E6 and Double Cusp Cata-
strophes using stacked 2- and 3-D \u201Ctableaus,\u201D has found marvelous defining features he
calls \u201Ctrance tunnels\u201D and \u201Cship's prows,\u201D through and with which one \u201Csteers\u201D in \u201Ccontrol
space,\u201D by use of \u201Ckeels\u201D and other sailing instruments.24 Now imagine our flat boundary
layer of \u201CTimaeus triangle\u201D unfoldings to be akin to the surface of deep waters plied by
fishing trawlers \u2013 with the fishermen throwing out seines we\u2019ve come to call by Hjelm-
slev's monicker. Then imagine the sea across which we're sailing to be a \u201Csentient
ocean,\u201D like that covering the surface of Stanislav Lem's Solaris. In the sci-fi classic, this
realm of Meaningful Flows can respond to our most secret wishes and thoughts with in-
stantly realizable architectural (and even sensual) manifestations. Something of the sort
is what we hope will be in store for us, as we begin to cast our net for Semiotic Squares
and other \u201Cdeep-sea creatures,\u201D in higher-dimensional Zero-Divisor spaces.

\u000C4. Struts, Tray-Racks, and Twisted Sisters: Bounding the Model from Above
         Let\u2019s start with the usual \u201Cassume true\u201D of so many mathematical proofs. Assume
it\u2019s the case, that is, that a Strut is a showcase for Semiotic Squares, as claimed. Let\u2019s
look simple-mindedly at what that means geometrically. On the vertex net we\u2019ve called a
Box-Kite, the 3 mutually orthogonal Struts are themselves diagonal lines \u2013 2 at a time in
each of the 3 mutually orthogonal Squares whose perimeters contain all 12 Box-Kite
edges. So we immediately see that the context in which we claim the Semiotic Square
should be housed has another level of \u201Cdouble articulation\u201D already enabled. These doub-
led-up SS\u2019s, or \u201CTray-Racks\u201D \u2013 named for those portable, snap-together-fast make-shift
table-tops, so perfect for holding TV dinners while your attention\u2019s focused on something
else \u2013 can have their perimeters traced in the manner of Sails. But aside from the obvious
4- vs. 3- fold symmetry, there\u2019s at least one other very big difference: since the edge-
signs regularly alternate from plus to minus as you circuit, there is no double covering;
instead, one has two distinct circuits which never intersect, each \u201Cmaking zero\u201D with each
of the 4 Assessors through which it threads. But where one Tray-Rack does so with the
slash, the other does its drive-by at the same site with the backslash.
         There is also a double articulation of product outcomes: in Sails, the 3rd vertex
has \u201Cpair production\u201D of its contents result from multiplication of the other two. With
Tray-Racks, each edge belongs to a different Sail, but a sort of \u201Cpair production\u201D still re-
sults \u2013 with a \u201Ctwist.\u201D In fact, in BK1, I called this second kind of multiplication just that:
a \u201Ctwist product.\u201D The ways in which it \u201Cdouble articulates\u201D are best explained by
defining it: if (iU + iL)(iU* + iL*) = 0, then (iU + iL*)(iU* \u2013 iL) does, too. (I leave off the te-
dious variations based on internal signing.) What we have, then, is a swapping rule: a
same-case-indexed unit of one partner in a mutual ZD pair is swapped for the correspond-
ing unit in the other, with the resultant ZD pairings having edge-signs toggled. (More,
just as in SS\u2019s, horizontal and vertical edges have different behaviors, with parallels of
one type \u201Ctwisting\u201D in tandem to opposite-type parallels on different Tray-Racks.) The
edge in question, meanwhile, is in a different Box-Kite \u2013 although, as we\u2019ll clarify next,
the Sail containing this alien edge is in the same Loop as the Sail we started with.
         The divide between Loop and Box-Kite, in fact, is the basis of this \u201Cdouble articu-
lation\u201D effect. Loops are just the non-associative algebraist's next best thing to Groups,
and Raoul Cawagas, after but independently of me, also eked out the patterns of ZD\u2019s in
the Sedenions, via the Loop-studying software he\u2019d designed for just such purposes.25
Except his 7 hitherto undiscovered 16-element Loops (ZD-harboring clones of Octonions,
which \u2013 being uninterested in Loop theory at the time of BK1 \u2013 I\u2019d simply given the silly
name of \u201Cautomorphemes,\u201D when I wasn\u2019t just referring to them as \u201CMoreno counter-
feits\u201D) partition into 4 subsystems, corresponding to Sails. These Loops, then, and my
Box-Kites, are duals: each Box-Kite\u2019s 4 Sails inhabit different Cawagas 16-Loops, and
vice-versa. Moreover, the patterns governing this duality are exceedingly orderly, and
can be catalogued with PSL(2,7) triangles I call \u201CTwisted Sisters\u201D diagrams, whose 7
nodes house the Strut Constants of the Box-Kites engaged in \u201Cswappings,\u201D while edges
have color-coded segments (one per each Tray-Rack) to flag in- and out- going matchups.
         As the phenomena just limned serve to bound our SS modeling \u201Cfrom above,\u201D
let\u2019s stop to take a look at what\u2019s just been sketched out so hurriedly. (Later arguments
about higher \u201Csemical harmonics\u201D will require, after all, some familiarity with such mat-
ters.) First, let\u2019s look at twist products, from one Tray-Rack to each of two others.

R. de Marrais                                Page 14                   \u201CPresto! Digitization: I\u201D
\u000C        To see the orderliness of the Twist, a standard presentation of the Tray-Rack is
needed. Regardless of Box-Kite, all 3 Tray-Racks share a structural invariance: unlike
the 4 Sails, which display a \u201C3+1\u201D symmetry between Trefoils and Zigzag in their cycling
patterns, each Tray-Rack displays a \u201C3+1\u201D in the orientation of ZD flows. Adopting an
\u201Covertone series\u201D convention that low bits are less volatile, hence less subject to move-
ment, we use them as points of reference.26 In each Tray-Rack, the orientation of L-bit
products is counterclockwise along 3 successive sides, with the 4th (with negative edge-
sign) showing a clockwise reversal. If we label them with the letters of the struts perpen-
dicular to them in the octahedron, Tray-Racks AF, BE, CD have reversed edges DE, FD,
EF respectively, each of which belongs to a Trefoil completed by the perpendicular\u2019s
Zigzag Assessor. (The \u201C3+1\u201D of Sails and Tray-Racks hence share the same source.)
Rotate their frames so that the top edge and the projection of the perpendicular on the
square\u2019s center define this Trefoil, and paint it in traffic-light colors: red, yellow, or
green for Tray-Racks labeled AF, BE, or CD. Call such presentations \u201CRoyal Hunt\u201D
diagrams, after the 5th line text of I Ching Hexagram 8, \u201CHolding Together\u201D: \u201CIn the hunt,
the king uses beaters on three sides only and foregoes game that runs off in front.\u201D
        The vertical lines, if twisted together (a \u201CV*\u201D operation), produce a Tray-Rack in
another Box-Kite, and likewise for the horizontals (\u201CH*\u201D). Further, performing H* or V*
twice is isomorphic to the workings of an associative triplet, indexed by the 3 Strut Con-
stants of the Tray-Racks\u2019 Box-Kites. Since twist results can be written in 2 different or-
ders, depending on whether the L or U units are swapped left to right, a convention to
minimize rewriting and maximize consistency is adopted: for top and left edges in \u201CRoy-
al Hunt\u201D setup, L\u2019s are swapped and U\u2019s held in place; for bottom and right edges, U\u2019s
are swapped and L\u2019s fixed. When this procedure is followed, H* produces a Tray-Rack
rotated 90o clockwise of \u201CRoyal Hunt,\u201D while V* produces one rotated an equal but oppo-
site amount. Depicted below are 2 of the 3 twist product sets for the S=3 Box-Kite.

\u000C        In general, the S of the Box-Kite we twist to, is easily shown to always equal the
index of the perpendicular\u2019s Vent Assessor, in the Tray-Rack twisted from. In the parti-
cular cases just shown, the S-triple (1,2,3) for Box-Kite 3 indicates all Tray-Racks are of
the same AF variety: this is unique to the \u201Ctrue\u201D Quaternion index set, and explains the
central red circle in the \u201CTwisted Sisters\u201D diagram. The \u201CRoyal Hunt\u201D sequence for the
same Box-Kite\u2019s BE Tray-Rack, by contrast, requires all 3 colors for its (3, 6, 5), as do
most S-triples. Since Strut Constants for 2N-ions are always less than 2N-1, the Sedenions\u2019
\u201CTwisted Sisters\u201D diagram has \u20184\u2019 (i.e., the Octonions\u2019 \u2018G\u2019) in the center, where it plays a
role opposite the one it adopts with index multiplication: as symmetry breaker (viz., 347
and 246\u2019s 2-coloring, 145\u2019s color ordering). All other paths are quite regular. We\u2019ve
seen the \u201Cinner circle\u201D of Quaternion indices forms an all-red circle of clockwise flows.
The nodes at medians point inwards with green; yellows point into the vertices. The
clockwise flowing on the perimeter always leaves a node with green, passes through yel-
low, then comes to a stop at its terminus with red (the \u201Ctraffic light\u201D sequence).
        Such PSL(2,7)-based diagrams exist in the Pathions as well, shown in BK4 by the
\u201CStereo Fano\u201D synergies of paired PSL(2,7)\u2019s shorthanding the layout of the 14-Assessor,
7-Box-Kite ensembles (7 Pl\u00E9iades plus the \u201CAtlas\u201D), and can serve to refine the classify-
ing of Box-Kites, now that the Strut Constant proves no longer unique, hence too coarse.
                                       We will not be concerned with them here, but we
                                       will care about the general phenomenon of studying
                                       structures like Sails and Tray-Racks which thread
                                       ZD\u2019s, and which we\u2019ll refer to in the abstract as
                                       \u201Clanyards\u201D \u2013 those strands of leather, string or plastic
                                       upon which charms or beads are queued, to make
                                       closed loops of jewelry. They roughly do service in
                                       ZD work comparable to what Groups, built on \u20181\u2019
                                       and notions of Identity, do in standard algebra and
                                       number theory. Informally, lanyards are linked lists
                                       such that each diagonal of each Assessor threaded is
                                       left-multiplied to make zero once only, with closure.
The Sail is a doubly linked list, with all diagonals in the 3 Assessors visited being thread-
ed in one 6-cycle; Tray-Racks, also doubly linked, only provide single covering, hence
come in pairs, each cover threading half the diagonals without intersecting the other.
        Two more lanyards are highly significant: the Quincunx threads 5 Assessors, and
can be interpreted as a strategy to go around the obstacle to traffic flow the top edge of a
\u201CRoyal Hunt\u201D diagram represents: by detouring up the Strut perpendicular to the Tray-
Rack, then coming back to the endpoint of the bypassed segment, a 10-cycle double cov-
ering can be achieved without \u201Cgoing against the flow\u201D of the natural \u201CL-bit\u201D orientation.
A doubly astonishing connection exists between the symmetry of choices available and
the icosahedral reflection group: doubly so, as the connection of the \u201Cobstacle bypass\u201D
problem in Singularity Theory to this same group caused a big to-do when members of
Arnol\u2019d\u2019s circle discovered it (then heard, as well, that diagrams of the wavefront indicat-
ing this symmetry had appeared in the first-ever analysis text by l\u2019H\u00F4pital, who likely de-
rived them ultimately from Huyghens himself!).27 Finally, all12 diagonals are threaded
by the polyrhythmic \u201CBicycle Chain\u201D of \u00BE-Tray-Rack scans, linked by \u201C\u2013\u201D-edge jumps:
an inviting candidate for NKS-style simulation work \u2013 about which, more toward the end.

\u000C5. First Pass at the Model, and the Route to Fractals
         The correspondence of Semiotic Squares as modeled by ZD subsystems with the
CT treatment of Petitot is further reinforced by the fact that the \u201Cceiling\u201D of our approach,
as indicated by the just-discussed Tray-Rack-based \u201Cswapping\u201D problem twist products
handle, is also at a level above his SS model. As an index of the limits of CT modeling
itself, one must employ the highest one-behavior stratum of the Double Cusp, the A7
\u201CStar,\u201D to effect such bartering \u2013 and even then, the result is not quite satisfying!28
         This shared \u201Cbounding from above\u201D of both ZD-based and Petitot models is un-
derscored by the Tray-Rack\u2019s relationship to the second (right isosceles) \u201CTimaeus Tri-
angle,\u201D and hence the Double Cusp, whose \u201Cextended Dynkin diagram\u201D is a box whose 4
corners house \u201Cbasins of attraction\u201D separated by saddles on their edges, and joined by
diagonals which cross in a mountainous \u201Cmaximum\u201D (and whose so-called \u201Cgeneric sec-
tion\u201D in Control Space is the 4-cusped curvilinear square known as an \u201CAstroid\u201D).29 But
do we truly need 16-D to contextualize both? We\u2019ll want to consider how the models are
jointly \u201Cbounded from below.\u201D But to do so, we need an initial presentation of our own,
in Greimas\u2019s terms.
         To begin at the beginning: in Greimas\u2019s Structural Semantics, whose analysis of
Propp\u2019s wondertale morphology led directly to the SS diagram, Greimas asks us what, on
the linguistic plane, we mean when we say we \u201Cperceive differences\u201D? He answers his
own question in a doubly articulated fashion:

           1. To perceive differences means to grasp at least two object-terms as
       simultaneously present.
           2. To perceive differences means to grasp the relationship between the
       terms, to link them together somehow.30

        We are next told that \u201Csimultaneous grasping\u201D implies its own dyad: first, one ob-
ject alone doesn\u2019t carry signification; second, this perceiving together implies both some-
thing shared between them (the \u201Cproblem of resemblance\u201D) and (in order to discern there
are, indeed, two or more of them) something somehow different, which serves to distin-
guish them. Resemblance and difference, then, are part of what is simultaneously present
\u2013 within perception as such \u2013 before we can speak at all of what it is we\u2019ve perceived.
(Not to mention, the how and why of it.) We then must make our starting point the notion
of reciprocal presupposition (Hjelmslev\u2019s solidarity), as within the percept as such, the
one object-term can carry no significance without the other. This is not only the most
important assumption Greimas requires of us; it \u201Cis the only undefined logical concept
which allows us to define reciprocally, following Hjelmslev, signifier and signified.\u201D31
        But Greimas and Hjelmslev both want to transplant this notion to virtually every
stratum of description: the theory of signification, then, is but a \u201Csurface effect\u201D; what
they\u2019re after would use this sole \u201Cundefined logical concept\u201D in its arsenal as an all-pur-
pose tool. To reach the Semiotic Square from here, one \u201Cdouble articulates\u201D what we\u2019ve
just been given, and assumes that meaning is the result of the interlinking of two such
dyads, giving us the Square\u2019s four corners. But the verticals, which effect the soldering
between the initially unrelated dyadic \u201Csemes,\u201D do not, by dint of their opportunistic na-
ture, entail reciprocal presupposing, but only the one-way notion of \u201Cimplication,\u201D with
the lower term somehow \u201Ccontaining\u201D or being \u201Cgeneratively linked to\u201D the one above it.

R. de Marrais                             Page 17                  \u201CPresto! Digitization: I\u201D
\u000C         Greimas also tells us that the diagonals, which indicate \u201Ccontradiction\u201D between a
seme and the absence of same, is linked to another of Jakobson\u2019s 3 primary categories of
binary opposition, called \u201Cprivation\u201D: 2 phonemes, otherwise identical, differ in the pre-
sence of a mark: \u2018g\u2019 is voiced; \u2018k\u2019 is not. Is not the simplest way to indicate this by a
simple on/off bit \u2013 what \u201CG toggling\u201D gives? Giving a commonsensical yes to this ques-
tion quickly tells us our S should mark the vertical \u201Cimplication\u201D pathway. Here\u2019s why.
         First, mapping G to the \u2018privative\u2019 pathway means, once we\u2019ve made our way
through the blizzard of names Greimas and his interpreters have used to highlight the
various attributes each pathway is assumed to display \u2013 as a relation between \u201Cparadig-
matic\u201D place-holders or \u201Cstates\u201D on the semantic plane; as \u201Csyntagmatic\u201D segments in a
performance of state-to-state syntax, itself dependent upon an \u201Cactantial\u201D analysis which
further discriminates \u201Cactants\u201D from \u201Croles\u201D; etc. \u2013 that we see it simply as the pure form
of the foundational Box-Kite binary, mutual exclusivity, implicit in saying 2 terms contra-
dict each other: if Castor is present, Pollux is not. But G alone, for reasons already cov-
ered, offers the possibility of linking this XOR notion to a no-exceptions, \u201C+\u201D or \u201C\u2013\u201D.32
         Next, reciprocal presupposition is the basis of linking the two semes into one se-
mantic bundling, and this operation is inherently (and explicitly described this way by
Greimas as) hierarchical: conjunction on one level, disjunction on the other. Horizontal
pathways are thus the only places that can say \u201CX\u201D marks the spot: for we then have the
ZD diagonals themselves on one level, and the units spanning their plane (and defining
their equations as just k(iU + iL)) on the other. By elimination, \u201CS\u201D must be the vertical.
         But one can argue positively, as well: given a seme, the first thing we frame is a
notion of its absence (hence, the \u201Ccontradiction\u201D pathway: mice only play in the lower
right slot if the seme \u201Ccat\u201D is absent in the upper left; if a \u201Clight\u201D seme is switched off,
barracks-bound recruits start sleeping \u2013 or maybe vampires leave their coffins). So, be-
fore we can consider the possibility of fusing two semes into a Square (which \u201Cmergers
and acquisitions\u201D work is what the \u201Cimplication\u201D process underwrites), we already have
\u201CG\u201D in hand \u2013 and, for any given CDP level (which is what \u201CG,\u201D as a power of 2, suffices
to indicate) the necessary precondition for such union is \u201CS.\u201D For Sedenions, all \u201CS\u201D
values generate successful candidates for ZD status when our simple production rule is
used; for Pathions and higher 2N-ions, however, carry-bit overflow puts this status in
question, if S exceeds 8 and is not equal to some higher power of 2. For Pathions, this
means all S > 8 yield ensembles of 3 Box-Kites instead of 7, with the 7 distinct patterns
having a clear \u201Cflip-book\u201D sequencing determined strictly by simple unit in- or de- cre-
ments to S. For the 64-D Chingons, 3 distinct ranges display different-sized ensembles.
As N increases further, we essentially are faced with a \u201Cspectroscopy\u201D problem.

\u000C         To make this seem concrete, and see how it relates to attaining the NT \u201Cfractal
limit,\u201D a review of \u201Cemanation tables\u201D (on which, see BK2) is in order. These do for
ZD\u2019s what Cayley Tables do for group operations. For a particular stratum of 2N-ions, K
= (2N-1 \u2013 2) Assessors interact in Box-Kite ensembles for a given Strut Constant value: 6,
14, 30, 62 for N = 4, 5, 6, 7, and so on. For any S value, regardless of carry-bit overflow,
we can make a K x K product table, place Assessor labels on each row and column head,
and enter the results in the appropriate cells. Define headings in left-right, top-down or-
der, entering lowest L-index first, and put that of its strut-opposite in the mirror-opposite
slot; put the next-lowest not yet entered to the right of the first (and its strut-opposite just
left of the first such); continue in this manner until all L-indices are accounted for.
         If Assessors indicated by headings for a cell mutually zero-divide, put their ema-
nation (instead of \u201C0\u201D) in the cell; otherwise, leave it empty. For all such tables, both
long diagonals will form an empty \u201CX\u201D, since strut-opposites and an Assessor\u2019s own dia-
gonals never mutually zero-divide. For S values not subject to overflow, all other K2 \u2013
2K cells ( = 24, 168, 840 for N = 4, 5, 6) will be filled. As this number is always a multi-
ple of 24 (the number of cell entries defining a Box-Kite), this means Strut Constants,
beyond the Sedenions, underwrite ensembles of interconnected Box-Kites: 7, 35, 155,
and 651 for N = 5, 6, 7, 8 (also the number of associative triplets for N = 3, 4, 5, 6).
         For S values where carry-bits matter, things get more complicated. As explained
in BK2, the 7 Pathion emanation tables for 8 < S < 16 are more sparse than expected:
only 72 cells (= 3 Box-Kites) are filled. With Chingons, 3 broad classes emerge in 64-D,
the first of which \u2013 due to its obvious \u201Cfractality\u201D \u2013 we\u2019ll examine in detail later on.
         8 < S < 16 gives 19 instead of the \u201Cfull set\u201D of 35. Within this range, take the
Sedenion \u201Csand mandala\u201D with the same S, chop it into quadrants, and attach copies of
each to the starter image\u2019s corners. For S=15, fill the 8 same-sized regions on the peri-
meter with mirrorings of the starter-image quadrants, but with the empty diagonal stret-
ches replaced by 16\u2019s (or, if the diagonal below contains 8\u2019s not 7\u2019s, by \u201Cstrut-opposite\u201D
31\u2019s), and all other indices augmented by 16. Analogous \u201Cperiod-doubling\u201D strategies
obtain in higher reaches, indicating an emanation-table-based route to the fractal limit as
N increases. (See drawings on left, below, for S=15 in Pathions, then Chingons.34) For
16 < S < 24, we've 7 Box-Kites, whose 14 x 14 central square mimes the Pathion emana-
tion table for S \u2013 8, sans the crossing pairs of near-solid parallels \u2013 making the central
square for S=24 empty. 24 < S < 32 gives 23 Box-Kites (for S=25, see below right \u2013 and
note how \u201Cwhite space,\u201D unlike for S=15, is filled with, not empty of, entries!).

\u000CAppendix: Box-Kite \u201CDo-It-Yourself Kit\u201D

        The basic \u201CBox-Kite Machine\u201D is an interactive form with 2 slots and 2 buttons:
enter the power of 2 which generates the 2N-ions of interest, then enter the Strut Constant
(any value from 1 to 2N \u2013 1) of the Box-Kite ensemble you wish to explore. Click the
\u201CProduce Tone Row\u201D button, and the lower parts of the form fill in in a split second: low
and high indices of all the Assessor pairs, in emanation-table row and column, with the
full spelling out of these dyads in the \u201CTone Row Pairs\u201D listing at the end. After you've
spent about two seconds getting that much produced (with maybe 200 lines of code doing
the work \u201Cunder the hood\u201D), you click one more button to \u201CCreate Emanation Table\u201D
according to the specifications. Except for N pushing two digits or worse, the CSV text-
file dumped out by this operation takes a split second, and then you just roll over into an
Excel spreadsheet, import said textfile into a worksheet, and then play with colorizing.
        Ignoring user-interface overhead (\u201Cexiting event\u201D code in field slots and other
stuff that's part of the \u201Cimplementation cost\u201D but otherwise irrelevant), the whole machine
runs on only 3 little programs (ca. 100 lines each, written in the Visual Basic customized
for the Notes object-hierarchy called \u201CLotusScript\u201D that the business analyst's workstation
I was building for a major investment house required I immerse myself in). I've attached
the highly inelegant code for these below. (Inelegant, because written superfast, under
duress of having things I was supposed to be doing that paid the bills; also, because the
library calls were subject to some parameter-passing bugginess that I had to do grotesque
workarounds to bypass, leading to very stupid-looking code. The point, though, was to
get this machine built in a hurry, and not worry about \u201Celegance\u201D!)
        This could easily be ported to Java or a Mathematica notebook, where much more
sophisticated things become possible (e.g., New Kinds of Databases and simulation work
based on them). The 3 modules do the following:

        1) Crunch Cayley-Dickson Process into a stupidly self-evident method for gener-
ating signed products of arbitrary imaginaries of any subscript (see the discussion of the 3
rules that run everything in my prior \u201CBK4\u201D paper on the Wolfram Science site: \u201CTriple
Negatives Rule\u201D and \u201CTrident Product\u201D and \u201CRecursive Bottoming\u201D and that's it).

       2) Given N and S, create the appropriate lower-index terms to serve as row and
column labels in the \u201Cemanation table,\u201D and then put them in proper order (being sure, of

        3) A double-for-loop which runs through the row-and-column listing of indices
twice, calculating the cell values in the table. There's 2 arrays for low- and high- index
units in the Assessors each such label signifies, and then the full Assessor of each row
label is multiplied times each column's full Assessor, and if they DO zero-divide, the
third Assessor in their Sail has its lower-index term entered in the appropriate cell. (If the
two Assessors do NOT mutually zero-divide, the cell is left blank).

        That's it! And if Part II's proof of the all-important Sky meta-fractal's existence

        The title of a highly influential precursor of \u201Csmall-world\u201D theory, Mark S. Granovetter's paper in The
    American Journal of Sociology, 78 (1973), 1360-1380, whose original context was, in fact, the way
    people find jobs: not, as one might at first assume, through their closest friends (since the overlap
    between their and one's own connections will be too great to provide too many \u201Cleads\u201D); but rather,
    through remote acquaintances (who have their own small groups of close friends, with which one is
    likely to have almost no intersection except through such \u201Cweak ties\u201D). \u201CSmall-world\u201D theory as such,
    meanwhile, derives from a paper whose influence has proven inversely proportional to its length: Dun-
    can J. Watts and Steven H. Strogatz, \u201CCollective dynamics of 'small-world' networks,\u201D Nature, 393
    (1998), 440-442. For a fuller presentation, see Duncan J. Watts, Small Worlds: The Dynamics of
    Networks Between Order and Randomness (Princeton NJ: Princeton University Press, 1999); for the
    intimate relationship between small-world and scale-free network theory, see Albert-L\u00E1szl\u00F3 Barab\u00E1si,
    Linked: How Everything Is Connected to Everything Else And What It Means for Business, Science,
    and Everyday Life (New York: Penguin Books, 2003). \u201CSix degrees of Kevin Bacon\u201D\u2013 a take on the
    title of John Guare's 1990 similarly-themed play, Six Degrees of Separation \u2013 derives from three inebri-
    ated fraternity brothers who managed to ride their goofy idea into TV and Internet exposure: see Ann
    Oldenburg, \u201CA thousand links to Kevin Bacon: Game calculates actor's connection,\u201D USA Today (Oc-
    tober 18, 1996), p. 51. One of the clearest instances of a \u201Csmall-world network,\u201D ironically, is provided
    by the Kevin-Bacon-like \u201CErd\u00F6s number\u201D of mathematical collaboration: those who've written papers
    with the prolific Hungarian have Erd\u00F6s number = 1; those who haven't collaborated with Erd\u00F6s himself,
    but have co-authored papers with people who have, have Erd\u00F6s number = 2; no mathematician who's
    ever collaborated on a paper has been found with Erd\u00F6s number higher than 17, and most \u2013 over
    100,000 \u2013 have Erd\u00F6s number 5 or 6: see Jerry Grossman's \u201C Erd\u00F6s Number Project Home Page,\u201D
    www.oakland.edu/~grossman/erdoshp.html. This is ironic, because Erd\u00F6s collaborated on a famous
    series of papers that created the theory of random networks \u2013 a beautiful theory which \u201Csmall-world\u201D
    thinking had to chuck out the window before it could find itself eliciting laws for real networks. Those
    with an obsession should also visit Brett Tjaden's \u201COracle of Bacon\u201D web page, which contains a list of
    the 1000 best-connected actors and their distribution sequences (many of the most connected of whom,
    surprise, are porn stars): www.cs.virginia.edu/bct7m/bacon.html.

    would seem that the point at which music and mythology began to appear as reversed images of each
    other coincided with the invention of the fugue, that is, a form of composition which, as I have shown on
    several occasions, exists in a fully developed form in the myths, from which music might at any time
    have borrowed it. If we ask what was peculiar about the period when music discovered the fugue, the
    answer is that it corresponded to the beginning of the modern age, when the forms of mythic thought
    were losing ground in the face of the new scientific knowledge, and were giving way to fresh modes of
    literary expression. With the invention of the fugue and other subsequent forms of composition, music
    took over the structures of mythic thought at a time when the literary narrative, in changing from myth to
    the novel, was ridding itself of these structures. It was necessary, then, for myth as such to die for its
    form to escape from it, like the soul leaving the body, and to seek a means of reincarnation in
    music.\u201D [Bold italics provided by this author, not the anthropologist.]

    we'll be working with, Ronald Schleifer's A. J. Greimas and the Nature of Meaning: Linguistics, Semio-
    tics and Discourse Theory (Lincoln NB: University of Nebraska Press, 1987). On p. 17, he explains
\u000C     that \u201C'Double articulation,' a term developed by Andr\u00E9 Martinet, is the presence \u2013 the reciprocal presup-
     position \u2013 of both combination and contrast. In this conception, language presents two distinct planes of
     analysis. Each of the 'units of the first articulation,' Martinet argues, 'presents a meaning and a vocal (or
     phonic) form. It cannot be analyzed into smaller successive units endowed with meaning . . . But the
     vocal form itself is analysable into a series of units each of which makes its contribution to distin-
     guishing t\u00EAte from other units such as b\u00EAte, tante, or terre.' In traditional linguistics, the first articulation
     is the combinatory of grammar (or morphology) while the second is that of phonology.\u201D As with CDP,
     redoubling can be extended indefinitely \u2013 and, in fact (\u201CHjelmslev's Net\u201D), must be.

     without the other: a double deterritorialization...\u201D (P. 392) And, in percipient conformity with the
     current theme, they develop a philosophy of Number they call \u201Cnomadic\u201D (cutely opposed to Leibniz's
     \u201Cmonadic\u201D) which is primordially topological: \u201CIt is the number itself that moves through smooth
     space.... The more independent space is from a metrics, the more independent the number is from
     space.\u201D (P. 389). Or again, \u201CSmooth space is a field without conduits or channels. A field, a
     heterogeneous smooth space, is wedded to a very particular type of multiplicity: nonmetric, acentered
     [i.e., not coordinated by Identity operators], rhizomatic multiplicities [tracing connections between
     inherent and palpable Singularities, rather than branchings from a unified Tree] that occupy space
     without 'counting' it and can 'be explored only by legwork.' [e.g., as embedded in a network].\u201D (P. 371)

         Of most moment, for our interests, is Deleuze\u2019s short essay, \u201CA quoi reconnait-on le structuralisme?,\u201D
     in F. Chatelet, ed., Histoire de la philosophie (Paris: Hachette, 1973), which Petitot discusses at length
     in Section 3.3, \u201CDeleuze\u2019s proposal for a schematism of structure,\u201D of his Morphogenesis of Meaning,
     transl. Franson Manjali (New York: Peter Lang, 2004; French original, 1985), henceforth MM. The
     notion of \u201Cplace-holder\u201D is argued to be fundamental to all structuralism, and the \u201Cempty place\u201D the
     basis of any notion of \u201Csymbolic.\u201D As Petitot notes, referring to this piece, \u201CThe identity of a symbolic
     place is not what ensures its stability, but what ensures the possibility of its displacement.... If the rela-
     tive displacement (metonymy) can be an intrinsic part of the identity of position, it is because every
     structure \u2018contains an object or an element which is quite paradoxical.\u2019 This paradoxical element is of a
     kind very different from the symbolic elements, the differential relations, and the singularities. It circu-
     lates within the series as if it was \u2018its own metaphor and its own metonymy\u2019 (p. 322). It lacks any onto-
     logical function (it is not an object), any self-likeness (it is not an image), and logical identity (it is not a
     concept) (p. 323). And if the relative displacements is [sic] an intrinsic part of positional identities, it is
     because the relative place of the terms in the structure depends on their absolute place in relation to this
     element.\u201D (Petitot\u2019s p. 61). But what can this \u2018quite paradoxical \u2018 element be but Zero in a place-based
     scheme of digitization, with structuralism thereby being an exercise, ultimately, in ZD representings?

        For what it's worth, this is a literal fact: octahedral lattices are known to be rigid; an octahedral box-
     kite with pairs of dowels joining along each strut axis in the center, effectively produces an 18-edged
     figure with 7 vertices. Per A. L. Loeb's degrees-of-freedom formula, rigidity requires E \u2265 3V \u2013 6, which
     means we get just the right count even if we somehow assume 3 dowels can magically (i.e., in purely
     \u201Cmathematical space\u201D) pass through the central 7th vertex without requiring their splitting into pairs of
     real-world sections. See the discussion on rigidity in Jay Kappraff, Connections: The Geometric Bridge
     Between Art and Science (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1991), pp. 270-3.

       Gell-Mann\u2019s \u201CEightfold Way,\u201D based on SU(3) symmetry \u2013 equivalently, A2 in \u201CDynkinese,\u201D which
     yields up the simplest Fold Catastrophe with germ X3 and one control working on the X monomial \u2013
     gets its count by taking the hexagon of roots (hence, the correspondence to the most primitive kid\u2019s
     kaleidoscope, made by 2 mirrors placed at a 60o angle, in \u201CCoxeter\u201D dialect) and adding 2. If the 2-D
     backdrop is assumed, closest packing of spheres within it (the link to coding theory) is just the root-
     count, 6: for A3, the 3-D closest-packing number of 12 is the root-count as well (or the image-count in a
     3-mirror kaleidoscope, mirrors 1 and 2, 2 and 3 meeting in dihedral angles of 60o to make a wedge). For
     4 and 5 dimensions, though, the closest packings correspond to the D-series root-counts associated with
     so-called \u201CFeynman checkerboard\u201D patterns, of 24 and 40 respectively (28 and 45, if \u201CCartan subalge-
     bras\u201D are included). For 6-, 7-, and 8- D, the E-series serves similarly, with respective root-counts of 72,
     128, and 240 (78, 133, and 248 with subscripts ladled in). Superstring theory\u2019s first great \u201Caha!\u201D
     occurred when the \u201Canomaly count\u201D for 16-D heterotic strings was shown to be 496: just the tally
     generated by two orthogonal spaces, each associated with the Octonions\u2019 (non-associative) algebra \u2013 or
     \u201CE8 x E8\u201D for short! Meanwhile, on the theme of \u201C84\u201D which triggered this note: it is perhaps ironic that
     this number is associated with the study of \u201CHurwitz Groups,\u201D which play a crucial role in the study of
     compact Riemann surfaces of genus at least 2 (whose automorphism groups have maximum order of 84
     (g\u20131)). It\u2019s well-known that a Hurwitz group of smallest order is a simple group, and as there\u2019s no
     Hurwitz group of order 84, then the discrete group of PSL(2,R) over the unique field with seven
     elements formed by the integers {0,1,2,3,4,5,6} under addition and multiplication modulo 7, has order
     twice 84 = 168, hence is \u201Csimple.\u201D This gives us the smallest finite projective space, the \u201CFano Plane\u201D \u2013
     which we navigate with the PSL(2,7) triangle! Given that all the \u201CA, D, E\u201D apparatus and form language
     can justly be said to be the extension of the symmetric wealth of implications stuffed inside the
     icosahedral E8, which in turn \u2013 as Galois showed \u2013 has a 60-element rotation group which is the first
     non-trivial group to be \u201Csimple,\u201D with the first Hurwitz group being the second, and Conway\u2019s
     \u201CMonster\u201D being the last, it is easy to believe two things: first, that the wealth of implications stuffed
     inside CDP ZD\u2019s, which are clearly as intimately connected to the Hurwitz group as \u201CA, D, E\u201D pheno-
     mena are to Galois\u2019 alternating group, is not just unexplored but huge; second, that both the Galois and
     Hurwitz \u201Csimple\u201D groups are minuscule compared to Conway\u2019s, with so many others straddling the
     enormous gap between them, suggesting that all our mathematical understanding at present is likely
     next to nothing from the \u201CGod\u2019s eye\u201D view! A good intro to Hurwitz groups, in a context which expli-
     citly includes the general setting wherein Timaeus and hyperbolic (hence Dolgachev\u2019s, per the coming
     Note 20) triangles emerge, is Chapter 6 of Gareth A. Jones and David Singerman, Complex Functions:
     An algebraic and geometric viewpoint (Cambridge UK: Cambridge University Press, 1987), coming to
     a head for us on p. 261. (P.S.: the Pathions have 77 Box-Kites; add the Sedenion 7, and get 84 again!)

     fer, Alan Velie, transl. (Lincoln NB and London: University of Nebraska Press, 1983; French original,
     1966), p. 129. If Greimas\u2019s \u201Ctwo marks\u201D be a pair of mutual ZD\u2019s, instead of oppositely signed in-
     stances of \u201CX\u201D (which we take to designate opposite termini of some Box-Kite edge); and if, finally, his
     \u201C+\u201D be replaced by a multiplicative sign, the correspondence between his setup and ours would be nigh
     complete. His choices of mathematical symbols being purely conventional (and hence, for the purposes
     of his argument, merely arbitrary), those suggested are just as viable as Greimas\u2019s own \u2013 and offer up
\u000C     the bonus of framing a substantive theory, as we will soon see. Note, too, we get the inherent split of his
     \u201Cmarks\u201D into dyads (the unit pairs comprising Assessors) \u201Cfor free\u201D this way \u2013 which gives us two
     mutually reinforcing readings of his \u201Cre-marks\u201D simultaneously.
17
       John Allen Paulos, Mathematics and Humor (Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press,

        This returns us to the theme of Note 15: the Hurwitz simple group \u2013 which, after all, is seminal for us,
     and hence our paradigmatic instance of the Fuchsian groups which were the subject of Poincar\u00E9\u2019s
     \u201CAha!\u201D experience. Returning to Jones and Singerman\u2019s text cited in that note, we read on p. 221 that
     \u201CThe connection between the group PSL(2,R) and hyperbolic geometry was discovered by Henri Poin-
     car\u00E9 (1854-1912) and published in 1882. (Poincar\u00E9 used this discovery to illustrate the sometimes
     spontaneous nature of mathematical creativity. He relates how, when boarding a bus, the idea suddenly
     came to him that the transformations he had used to define Fuchsian functions were identical with those
     of non-Euclidean geometry.)\u201D

     to the A-D-E Problem),\u201D Nieuw Arch. Wisk. 25 (1977), 257-307. More recently, John Baez has
     devoted many installments of his weekly website offerings to this theme; see, too, the discussions and
     numerous links on Tony Smith\u2019s website.

        See the discussion in V. I Arnol\u2019d, S. M. Gusein-Zade and A. N. Varchenko, Singularities of Differen-
     tiable Maps, Vol. I: The Classification of Critical Points, Caustics and Wave Fronts (Boston: Birkh\u00E4u-
     ser, 1985), pp. 183-6, 242-6. These 3 triangles are the bases of the 3 infinite families of \u201Cunimodular\u201D
     germs, typically written with 3 subscripts to the letter \u201CT\u201D (one for each power its X, Y, or Z \u201Cbehavior\u201D
     displays in the germ), these subscripts being just the fraction of a straight angle included in successive
     angles of the triangle. Hence, the Equilateral, Right Isosceles, and 30-60-90 of Plato\u2019s cosmogony are
     rendered in the following manner: T3,3,3; T2,4,4; T2,3,6 (also expressed, just to make things confusing, as P8,
     X9, and J10 in the literature, with X9 being Jim Callahan\u2019s preferred way of indicating the famous
     \u201CDouble Cusp\u201D Catastrophe). The \u201Cmaximal strata\u201D of these 3 are the finite E series of \u201Csimple\u201D germs
     \u2013 and these, in turn, can be interpreted as the symmetries of the Platonic Solids: E6, then, represents the
     tetrahedron; E7, the symmetrically dual cube and octahedron ; and E8, the dodeca- and icosa- hedral
     duals. These designations arise from a special \u201CA-D-E\u201D relationship known as the \u201CMcKay Correspon-
     dence,\u201D which is described in the just-cited reference (on p. 184) as follows: \u201CThese singularities may
     also be obtained from the regular polyhedra in three-dimensional Euclidean space or more precisely
     from the discrete subgroups of the group SU(2): they describe relations between the basic invariants of
     the groups. Ak corresponds to the polygons, Dk to the dihedra (the two-sided polygons)\u201D \u2013 and the E
     series, to the Solids as just indicated. Arnol\u2019d\u2019s associate Dolgachev has meanwhile (see p. 185) ex-
     tended these amazingly simplistic yet deep correspondences into higher reaches: the 14 \u201Cexceptional\u201D
     forms among the unimodular germs (i.e., comprising finite listings, like the E series among the \u201Celemen-
     tary\u201D germs), \u201Cmay be obtained from the 14 triangles in the Lobechevskii plane [and hence realizable by
     M. C. Escher-style \u201Chyperbolic tessellations\u201D] or more precisely from the discrete subgroups of the
     group SU(1,1) determined by them\u201D \u2013 with the triangles\u2019 angles, again, bearing exact correspondences
     to germinal exponents (in terms of what are now called the \u201CDolgachev numbers\u201D linked to them).

        James Callahan, \u201CBifurcation Geometry of E6,\u201D Mathematical Modeling, 1 (1980), 283-309 lays out
     the \u201CDynkinese\u201D implicit in E6 and how it decomposes into 3 classes of maximal strata: Petitot\u2019s Dual
\u000C     and Standard Butterfly forms, and the Umbilics which will concern us when we consider Trip-Sync-
     based \u201Cmessage-passing,\u201D in relation to the Semiotic Square as postmodernists see it. In sequal studies
     (the last two of which were co-authored with psychoanalyst Jerome Sashin), he developed the \u201Ctableau\u201D
     approach as a method for modeling emotional affect response: see \u201CA Geometric Model of Anorexia

     Cawagas\u2019 \u201CFinitas\u201D software, which he makes freely available, lets one calculate loops and other
     nonassociative structures rather easily in higher-dimensional contexts; he in fact found an equivalent
     manner of expressing my tabulations from BK1 in \u201Cloop language,\u201D which he presented in a 2004 paper
     to the National Research Council of the Philippines, \u201COn the Structure and Zero Divisors of the
     Sedenion Algebra\u201D; the correspondence which ensued after he communicated this to me proved
     delightfully engaging, and was the direct trigger for \u201CBK3.\u201D On reading this, he further suggested I was
     engaging in \u201Crepresentation theory\u201D \u2013 an intimation which surprised me at first, but then became an
     obsession \u2026 upon which much of this monograph can be blamed!
26
       Dually, we could assume the reverse, adopting an \u201Codometer-wheel reading\u201D convention, in which
     case, per the earlier discussion of U- and L- index flows around a Box-Kite\u2019s hexagon, counterclockwise
     and clockwise change places in what follows \u2026 and the flow-reversal happens along the Tray-Rack
     edge opposite that specified. (But either way, obstacle-bypassing still involves detouring to the Zigzag
     Assessor perpendicular to the Tray-Rack in question.)
27
       Arnol\u2019d has talked about this \u201Cboundary singularity\u201D in many places, but the best starting point is his
     book largely inspired by its amazing history as well as its surprising wealth of applications, Huygens and
     Barrow, Newton and Hooke , Eric J. F. Primrose, transl. (Basel, Boston, Berlin: Birkh\u00E4user Verlag,
     1990; Russian original, 1989). See especially Chapter 3: \u201CFrom Evolvents to Quasicrystals,\u201D pp. 53-66,
     where largely overlooked mathematics of two centuries\u2019 past are dusted off, put in their own and current
     contexts, and found to be an endless fount of surprises and new insights. Bennequin\u2019s lecture to the
     1984/5 Bourbaki seminar, \u201CCaustiques mystiques,\u201D first revealed, as Arnol\u2019d tells us in his introduction,
     \u201Cthat the first textbook on analysis, written by l\u2019H\u00F4pital from the lectures of Johann Bernoulli, contains a
     representation of the manifold of irregular orbits of the Coxeter group H3 (generated by reflexions in the
     planes of symmetry of an icosahedron). This representation appears there not in connection with the
     group of symmetries of the icosahedron, but as a result of investigations of evolvents of plane curves
     with a point of inflexion, investigations very close to those of Huygens (and possibly even carried out by
     him, although the first publication was apparently due to l\u2019H\u00F4pital). Illustrations appearing in recent
     works on the connection between the icosahedron and singularities of evolutes and evolvents and, it
     should be said, obtained by modern mathematicians not without difficulty and even with the help of
     computers, were already known at that time.\u201D What will intrigue us later is this: the icosahedral \u201Cgroup
     of symmetries\u201D is based on the 15 median-flips plus identity, hence resides in 16-D, with the singularity
     appearing on its 4-D boundary. But the Sedenions likewise live in 16-D, and \u2013 as Moreno points out \u2013
     have a 4-D \u201Cboundary\u201D of ZD-free lebensraum to complement the 12-D Box-Kites need. More,
     consider the \u201Cwords\u201D and their readings that Quincunx lanyards can generate. As Sails can be either
     Zigzags or Trefoils, here we have Feet or Hands: If the \u201Cdetour\u201D is to the Zigzag Assessor, we get 10
     possible starting points to read or write \u201C/////\\\\\\\\\\\u201D; if we avoid the traffic-flow obstacle by the Vent
     Assessor instead, we get 10 strings from this: \u201C/\\\\//\\//\\\\.\u201D Since scalar value along a diagonal doesn\u2019t
     matter, we are free to treat signing as binary \u201Cflow-orientation.\u201D And each Tray-Rack has its own
     Quincunx string-set. So 2 types x 3 Tray-Racks x 10 string-readings each x 2 flow-reversals = 120.
     Note further than Feet and Hands each break into two mirror-opposite 5-diagonal substrings, and that
     the 16-D singularity has (among other \u201Cpreparations\u201D) a dynamic defined by a \u201Cdouble Swallow\u2019s Tail\u201D
     (a Z5 germ, with 3 controls on the 3 low monomials, Z running down the left or right slope of Pascal\u2019s
     Triangle, depending upon whether it be set to X or Y), with the 4-D \u201Ccontent\u201D \u2013 the boundary singularity
     \u2013 unfolding the symmetric terms 1, xy, x2y2, x3y3 in a so-called \u201Copen\u201D Swallow\u2019s Tail. Finally, consider
     the workings of RNAi, which seems to be the master mechanism for turning genes off: it hunts for
     chunks of DNA made of mirror-image string-pairs; the Swallowtail, meanwhile, models self-destructive
     processes (Thom\u2019s \u201Csuicide catastrophe\u201D). In Thom\u2019s 1971 model, which will come up more than once
     here, the 5-fold-symmetric \u201Cpentagram\u201D unfolding effectively ends the \u201Ctransmission\u201D between Double
\u000C     Cusps if we adapt it to the heuristic in BK1, which is sketchily alluded to in Section 14. All of which
     commentary must suffer in the limbo of these notes until some later date, when something more formally
     elegant (or simulation-based in its substantiveness) can be said about it.

        Jean Petitot-Cocorda, Physique du Sens: De la th\u00E9orie des singularit\u00E9s aux structures s\u00E9mio-narratives
     (Paris: CNRS Editions, 1992), henceforth PS, pp. 388-394, discusses this in some detail, with generous
     graphical accompaniments, in the follow-up discussions of open problems upon completion of his \u201CSe-
     miotic Square\u201D arguments. In particular, he reverts to a second \u201CGreimas Glitch,\u201D framed in a 1973
     paper called \u201CUn probl\u00E8me de s\u00E9miotique narrative: les object de valeur.\u201D Here, Greimas focused on
     the conundrum posed by the seemingly simple (indeed, ubiquitous) phenomenon of \u201Cdouble transfer,\u201D
     which I must somehow magically negotiate, in spite of its epistemological difficulty, each time I un-
     pocket two quarters to procure the morning paper. This problem is so mysteriously intractible that
     \u201Ceven if one makes use of the Cuspoid X8 [the Star], it is not possible to schematize the double transfer
     in a simple manner.\u201D As we\u2019ll see later, the way the Star relates to our \u201Ctwist product\u201D is via a dynamic
     interaction between two (or even three ) Double Cusps \u2013 something we \u201Cget for free\u201D by \u201Ctwisting,\u201D
     since the pairs of ZD\u2019s before and after it reside, as said above in the main text, in different Box-Kites.
29
        Greimas\u2019s own \u201Cactantial\u201D analysis clearly requires this double-articulated approach to his SS: on the
     one hand, Thom\u2019s CT models explicitly derive from the \u201Cactantial\u201D approach of Tesni\u00E8re\u2019s El\u00E9ments de
     syntaxe structurale (Paris: Klincksieck, 1959), also a key source of Greimas\u2019s own thoughts, as Petitot
     has discussed at some length. The Double Cusp\u2019s \u201Cgeneric sentence\u201D with four minima has been an oft-
     discussed feature of any language models of the case-based variety since such models originated: see
     Zeeman, op. cit., where we are told in 1974 that the \u201Cmost interesting key to linguistics, therefore, seems
     to lie in the study of paths in the double cusp, and the associated sequences of entrances, exits and
     transfer between the 4 actors involved, and the comparison of these paths with Thom\u2019s original
     classification of basic sentences.\u201D (p. 632) These remarks should be compared with Greimas\u2019s own,
     from his 1976 study of Maupassant, cited in Schleifer, op. cit., p. 156: \u201Canalytical experience \u2013 both our
     own and that of other semioticians \u2013 has convincingly demonstrated that, to account for texts even a
     little complex, it is necessary to consider the possibility of exploding (\u00E9clatement) any actant into at
     least four actantial positions\u201D on the Semiotic Square.

        In what follows, I depend directly upon Greimas and Fran\u00E7ois Rastier, \u201CThe Interaction of Semiotic
     Constraints,\u201D Yale French Studies, 41 (1968), 86-105 \u2013 the essay anouncing the Semiotic Square and its
     isomorphism with (among other structures) the Klein Group (p. 88), and L\u00E9vi-Strauss\u2019s \u201Ccanonical law
     of myths\u201D (p. 89). My ZD labeling scheme serves to answer a deep question Petitot asks after showing
     the inadequacy of Boolean logic to handle the task: \u201CHow to conceive of relations of junction (conjunc-
     tion/disjunction) and of reciprocal presupposition which are \u2018pure\u2019, that is to say independent of the spe-
     cific semes whose value they determine?\u201D (MM, p. 30)

        Algirdas Julien Greimas and Jacques Fontanille, The Semiotics of Passions, Paul Perron and Frank
     Collins, transl. (Minneapolis and London: U. of Minnesota Press, 1993; French original, 1991). As the
     foreword to the English translation of this last book-length work by Greimas puts it, \u201CThe very fact that
     one of the first definitions in Descartes's theory deals with the relation between active nad passive expla-
     nations of passions had as a consequence the linking of passions not only to reason but also to actions.
     Within this framework Greimas's strategy was to work out a semiotic of passions, a pathemic semiotics
     founded on his own previously elaborated semiotics of action.\u201D (P. ix) The work concludes with a study
     of \u201Cthe general syntax of jealousy,\u201D wherein Racine's Roxane \u201Cgives us an almost complete and parti-
     cularly detailed realization of the microsequence\u201D of abstract patterns of emotional investment and
     hedging that constitute the \u201Cfiduciary\u201D dynamics of jealous entanglement as the Semiotic Square would
     model it (with the key characters at 3 of the Square's 4 corners, as well as giving us \u201Ca fourth position,\u201D
     encountered in the form of the 'gift of trust' that seems to correspond to an attachment formed by
     'abandoning distrust.' (P.182, where the diagram appears)
34
        The Chingon graphic for S=15 bears an obvious relationship to the combined effect of two Cesaro
     \u201Ctriangle sweeps\u201D initiated by [0,1] and [1,0], depicted on pp. 64-5 of Benoit Mandelbrot, The Fractal
     Geometry of Nature (San Francisco: W. H. Freeman, 1983; first edition, 1972). As we\u2019ll argue more
     formally later, the key is in the \u201Cspectrographic\u201D effect of all bits to the left of that in the \u20184's\u2019 position:
     each row and column in the S=15 emanation table will have all entries for 8, 16, 24 filled (save for those
     which fall on the long diagonals); redoubling for the same S and keeping the screen size constant would
     thereby induce a doubling of the number of such lines (as well as new subdiagonals in quadrants, etc.).
