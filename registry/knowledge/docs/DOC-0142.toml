## Key Contributions

### 1. The Canonical Strut Table (Page 3)

The strut constant for each box-kite is listed in the first cell of each row.
The Octonion indices of vertices A, B, C are in bold-face (forming the zigzag).
Their Assessor index-pairs are listed in columns A-F.

The \"inner XOR\" of the Octonion and Sedenion pairs defining the Assessors at
each box-kite vertex will always equal 8 + strut_constant.

| Strut | A     | B     | C     | D     | E     | F     |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| 1     | 3, 10 | 6, 15 | 5, 12 | 4, 13 | 7, 14 | 2, 11 |
| 2     | 1, 11 | 7, 13 | 6, 12 | 4, 14 | 5, 15 | 3,  9 |
| 3     | 2,  9 | 5, 14 | 7, 12 | 4, 15 | 6, 13 | 1, 10 |
| 4     | 1, 13 | 2, 14 | 3, 15 | 7, 11 | 6, 10 | 5,  9 |
| 5     | 2, 15 | 4,  9 | 6, 11 | 3, 14 | 1, 12 | 7, 10 |
| 6     | 3, 13 | 4, 10 | 7,  9 | 1, 15 | 2, 12 | 5, 11 |
| 7     | 1, 14 | 4, 11 | 5, 10 | 2, 13 | 3, 12 | 6,  9 |

**Properties:**
- Vertices A, B, C form the zigzag (all-minus-sign sail).
- Their L-indices (the octonion part, listed first) form a NATO triplet.
- The strut pairs are (A, F), (B, E), (C, D) -- strut-opposites never form DMZs.
- Each box-kite excludes exactly one octonion index (1-7), the strut constant.

### 2. Naming Conventions

| Symbol | Dimension | Name      | Origin                     |
|--------|-----------|-----------|----------------------------|
| R      | 1         | Reals     | standard                   |

### 3. Pathion (32D) Structure

- Pathions have 15 x 7 = 105 \"16-less\" triplets of form (O, S, P')
  yielding 210 Assessors in 15 ensembles (sand mandalas).
- In addition, 42 of the (P, P') pairings are ZDs, giving 504 \"irreducible\" ZDs
  specific to Pathions. With 84 from Sedenions, total is **588** = 3.5x Moreno's count.
- Each sand mandala has 14 Assessors, all sharing the same inner XOR.
- They house 168 fillable cells each (= |PSL(2,7)|).

### 4. Kite-Chain Middens

- Box-kite \"harmonics\" extend indefinitely into higher 2^n-ions.
- For Sedenion box-kites, harmonics are obtained by adding 16n to assessor indices.
- Two \"Assessor harmonics\" with indices (o + 16n, S + 16n) and
  (o' + 16n, S' + 16n) will emanate some (o xor o' = S xor S') in the base box-kite.
- The first harmonic (Pathions only) gives 2x the ZD-diagonals of a base box-kite.

### 5. Emanation Tables

- 15 spreadsheet-like layouts (14 x 14) for the Pathion sand mandalas.
- Cell (row, col) = O or S index of the ZD \"emanated\" by multiplying row-head's
  Assessor times column-head's Assessor, with appropriate edge-sign prefix.
- Both long diagonals are always empty (self-products and strut-opposites).
- Remaining 14^2 - 2*14 = 168 cells fillable.
- For strut constants > 8: only 72 of 168 cells contain emanations.
- For strut constant = 8: \"edge polarization\" -- peculiar alignment of edge-signs
  by quadrant (all same in upper-left and lower-right, all opposite elsewhere).

### 6. Sand Mandala Patterns (Page 15)

The seven 72-entry tables (with strut constants > 8) display patterns
reminiscent of cellular automata when viewed in sequence. When folded
along row/column midlines, they overlay precisely the vertices of the
Box-Kite whose strut constant equals the \"excess\" (strut_constant - 8).

### 7. Sedenion Multiplication Table (Page 12)

The 16x16 multiplication table for sedenion basis elements (indices 0-15)
is provided, using a checkerboard shading scheme. Below it, the complete
listing of 155 NATO triplets for the Pathions is given.

### 8. Curvature Tensor Connection (Page 6)

De Marrais notes the box-kite diagram is structurally identical to Milnor's
visualization (from Morse Theory) of the four symmetries of the Riemann
curvature tensor:
1. Skew-symmetry: R(X,Y)Z + R(Y,X)Z = 0
2. Cyclic sum: R(X,Y)Z + R(Y,Z)X + R(Z,X)Y = 0
3. Bracket skew-symmetry: <R(X,Y)Z,W> + <R(X,Y)W,Z> = 0
4. Inner/outer exchange: <R(X,Y)Z,W> = <R(Z,W)X,Y>

Abstract. G. Moreno's abstract depiction of the Sedenions' normed zero-divisors as homomorphic to the
exceptional Lie group G2, is fleshed out by exploring further structures the A-D-E approach of Lie alge-
braic taxonomy keeps hidden. A break-down of table equivalence among the half a trillion multiplication
schemes the Sedenions allow is found; the 168 elements of PSL(2,7), defining the finite projective triangle
on which the Octonions' 480 equivalent multiplication tables are frequently deployed, are shown to give the
exact count of primitive unit zero-divisors in the Sedenions. (Composite zero-divisors, comprising all
points of certain hyperplanes of up to 4 dimensions, are also determined.) The 168 are arranged in point-set
quartets along the 42 Assessors (pairs of diagonals in planes spanned by pure imaginaries, each of which
zero-divides only one such diagonal of any partner Assessor). These quartets are multiplicatively organized
in systems of mutually zero-dividing trios of Assessors, a D4-suggestive 28 in number, obeying the 6-cycle
crossover logic of trefoils or triple zigzags. 3 trefoils and 1 zigzag determine an octahedral vertex structure
we call a box-kite -- seven of which serve to partition Sedenion space. By sequential execution of proof-
driven production rules, a complete interconnected box-kite system, or Seinfeld production (German for
field of being; American for 1990's television's Show About Nothing), can be unfolded from an arbitrary
Octonion and any (save for two) of the Sedenions. Indications for extending the results to higher dimen-
sions and different dynamic contexts are given in the final pages.

\u000C{ 0 } Introduction: Some two centuries ago, de Moivre, Argand, Gauss, et al., determined that square

roots of negative unity could be domesticated (and rendered geometric) by the introduction of cyclical 2-D

numbers, ironically (given their futurity) deemed \u201Cimaginary.\u201D Since then, a succession of \u201Cperiod

doublings,\u201D to borrow the Chaos theorists\u2019 term, has produced ever more exotic numbers \u2013 but at the cost

of a loss of familiar behavior with each escalation. Already with the Imaginaries, the angular nature of the

exponent made a product\u2019s \u201Cwinding number\u201D indeterminate. With the doubling to 4-D effected by

Hamilton\u2019s Quaternions, three imaginary axes now could serve to map the composition of forces in the 3-D

space of mechanics, with the fourth axis of Reals relating to time or tension . . . but at the cost of

commutation. (Also lacking, of course, in the physical world such \u201Cvector mechanics\u201D would model). The

redoubling to the 8-D Octonions of Cayley-Dickson algebra required surrendering associativity \u2013 and

swallowing the cause-effect indeterminacy such \u201Cparenthesis -placement uncertainty\u201D implied. Hurwitz\u2019

century-old proof, meanwhile, showed that further twofold \u201Cblow-ups\u201D in dimension of the number system

would require the breakdown of the very notion of a division algebra: divisors of zero, for starters, would

be let in at the same door the distributive property would exit through.

         The development of quantum mechanics has made it clear that the benefits of such redoublings

have, on the whole, outweighed the costs. The semi-simple Lie-group taxonomizing associated with

Dynkin\u2019s (and, among geometers, Coxeter\u2019s) work has meanwhile allowed these developments to be tamed

in a benign set of ball-and-stick diagrams, associated with neutral-sounding letters and indices. The com-

plex numbers are A2, having the structure of 2-D closest packing patterns and the hexagonal arrays of

Eisenstein integers generated by the cube roots of the positive and negative units. The 24 integer Quater-

nions conform to the \u201CFeynman checkerboard\u201D pattern of D4; and \u2013 most spectacularly of all \u2013 the closest

packing of spheres in 8 dimensions, and the exceptional E8 related to icosahedral symmetry, correspond

precisely to the 240-element integer arithmetic Coxeter elicited for Octonions.

         Guillermo Moreno\u2019s recent (1997) discovery of the G2 homomorphism governing the zero

divisors in the 16-D Sedenions[1] would seem, on the surface, to be the latest triumph of this \u201CA-D-E\u201D

approach. And indeed, having conquered virtually all taxonomic work in all areas of mathematics where

finite typologies are pertinent, this is what we\u2019ve come to expect. It\u2019s been only a quarter century since the

great Russian dynamicist Vladimir Arnol\u2019d discovered that \u201CA-D-E\u201D could house much more than the



                                                      Page 2
\u000C\u201Cparticle zoos\u201D of the physicists (and the complete catalog of Coxeter\u2019s kaleidoscopes). The classification

of singularities begun by Ren\u00E9 Thom\u2019s Catastrophe Theory could be engulfed and extended by it, an

embarrassment of riches leading Arnol\u2019d to speak of the \u201CA-D-E Problem.\u201D[2] Today, there is likely no

item in the Coxeter-Dynkin \u201Calphabet soup\u201D that lacks a surprising realization as an unfoldable singularity

with boundaries or other constraints (or a projective-pencil \u201Calcove\u201D in Tits\u2019 theory of buildings, or a class

of quivers, light caustics, shock-waves or self-correcting error codes). Moreno\u2019s G2 would thereby seem to

be another indicator of what Arnol\u2019d called the A-D-E-induced \u201Cmysterious unity of all things.\u201D[3]

         But Moreno discovered a homomorphism -- a \u201Cblow-up\u201D of an exact correspondence \u2013 and the

\u201Cblow-ups\u201D in the history of number theory have all entailed the loss of something. We know now that

among the numerous copies of the Octonions floating in the extra lebensraum of the Sedenion\u2019s 16-D, we

can find divisors of zero harbored among them according to G2 \u2019s 12-fold (or 14-fold, depending upon the

questions asked) logic. But how many such distinct sets of G2 \u2019s are there? Of what do these sets in fact

consist? What is the dynamic meaning of zero-division in their context?



{ I } Names, Notations, Conventions, Initial Constructions:

         As Moreno makes clear, a Sedenion zero divisor (unlike those in standard low-dimensioned Cliff-

ord algebras, typically generated by mutually annihilating idempotents with real components) is composed

of purely imaginary units. \u201CDoubly pure,\u201D in his terminology, as he implicitly concerns himself only with

what will be called herein \u201Cprimitive\u201D zero-divisors, comprised of diagonals in planes spanned by pairs of

imaginary units. (We will see that additive sums of up to four such primitives also exist, and for such com-

posites it will no longer make much sense to focus, as Moreno does, on \u201Cnormed unit\u201D divisors: hyper-

planes of up to 4 dimensions will be found, all of whose points are zero-divisors, so that the infinity of

points on their unit spheres would all qualify for \u201Cnormed unit\u201D status.)

         The Sedenions\u2019 primitive zero-divisors will be referred to by a special name, \u201CAssessors,\u201D and the

systems of these which mutually zero-divide each other (unlike the mutually annihilating pairs familiar

from Clifford algebra[4]) will be called \u201CCo-Assessor trios.\u201D And while technically there are four \u201Cnormed

unit\u201D zero-divisors on the extended X that is an Assessor, in fact plus or minus differences along one or the

other diagonal have no effect on the basic dynamics. I prefer, therefore, to think of each Assessor\u2019s \u201CX\u201D as


                                                     Page 3
\u000C                       0
made of two infinite (S -normed) lines, one an orthographic slash, the other a backslash, all points of which

are zero-divisors with respect to one or the other such line of a Co-Assessor: \u2018/\u2019 + \u2018\\\u2019 = \u2018X\u2019. In the spirit of

the bit-twiddling to come, I call these paths \u201CUNIX \u201D and \u201CDOS \u201D respectively (\u201Cu\u201D and \u201Cd\u201D for short) after

the two dominating computer operating systems which differ in their bent for the one or the other.

         The name of the entity we\u2019re focused on herein is suggested by the \u201C42 Assessors\u201D of the Egyptian

Book of the Dead, who sit in two rows of 21 along opposite walls of the Hall of Judgement.[5] During the

soul\u2019s so-called \u201CNegative Confession\u201D (and our focus is almost solely on units which are roots of negative

unity), they ask embarrassing questions while the heart of the deceased is weighed in a pan-balance and

the soul-eating Devourer of the Unjustified watches. The three senses of Zero implicit in the italicized

words (and the need for two pans to achieve a balanced measurement), added to the coincidence of the

count, made the name seem an appropriate mnemonic.

         Our strategy, in some regards, is opposite Moreno\u2019s. He approaches things head on by attempting

to typify the non-standard or \u201Cspecial\u201D features found in Sedenions that make zero-division possible. Here,

we\u2019ll be using everything we can that\u2019s nascent in associative triplets \u2013 be they pure Octonions (\u201CO-trips\u201D

henceforth) or inclusive of a pair of pure Sedenions (\u201CS-trips\u201D) \u2013 as a sprinter would exploit a thrust-block.

Ditto for Moreno\u2019s results. Rather than concluding with a \u201CG2 \u201D existence proof, we begin with a dissatis -

fied need for a concrete revelation which the \u201CG2 \u201D finding has exacerbated.

         Recalling that zeros of equations are roots, and G2 root structure is an overlay of two hexa gonally

symmetric kaleidoscopes (a \u201Cdoubled A 2 \u201D), this means two distinct orbits of differing \u201Croot length.\u201D This

latter designation makes sense in the standard 3-D renderings of the 12 roots of the algebra found, for

instance, in Gilmore[6]. In the 8-D of an Octonion copy, the 6-cycle weaving between DOS and UNIX

paths of Asses sor triples, revealed by our first production rule, will provide the correspondence to the

classic A 2 image. Our second production rule will show how any Assessor pair can spawn another, in a

distinct A 2 -like orbit, by a skew-symmetric swap of their non-O-trip units. Thanks to the Cartan subalge-

bra, though, Lie algebraists think of G2 as 12 + 2 = 14-dimensional, displayed most blatantly in the fact of

the 7 O-trips, each equipped with a binary orientation (they\u2019re associative, but not commutative!).




                                                     Page 4
\u000C         To keep the tools clean, we\u2019ll refer not to \u201CG2 \u201D but GoTo listings of the 12 Co-Assessor matches

associated with each O-trip. Our third production rule, finally, will take us beyond local O-trip specifics to

links between Octonion copies in Sedenion space (each Assessor appears in exactly 2 of the 7 GoTo lists).

         We\u2019ll be short-handing zero-divisor pairs by use of their imaginary units\u2019 index numbers. Equa-

tions which would solve for these will be written as either (A, B) and (C, D) when signing doesn\u2019t matter,

or else as either (A + B) or (C \u2013 D), to indicate a pair of partially or completely unknown units whose path

of interest is UNIX or DOS respectively. (Hence, (\u2013 A \u2013 B) is UNIX, so (A + B) covers it, while (\u2013 C + D)

is covered by ( C \u2013 D ).) Often, we\u2019ll have recourse to the binary variable \u201Csg\u201D (which can only be +1)

operating, say, between a \u2018+\u2019 or \u2018\u2013\u2019 and the right-hand letter within the parentheses.

         Most critically, we will indicate the product of two units A and B of unknown index like this: A

xor B. This leads to the all-important convention in choice of labeling the Sedenions: the index of the

product of two units must be the result of the XOR of the indices of the two units being multiplied. This

requires some (brief) commentary.

         The number of different ways one can label the Octonion units with suitable indices (480) is bad

enough; but Sedenions are even worse (half a trillion!). Different authors have different tastes, and mine

require products\u2019 indices be the XOR of the indices producing them. This is well-known to be possible, but

seldom exploited as a key feature (but see Michael Gibbs\u2019 pages giving \u201CBit Representations of Clifford

Algebras\u201D posted on Tony Smith\u2019s web-site[7]). Without this simplifying constraint, in fact, none of the

many \u201Cbit-twiddling\u201D proofs to follow would be possible! Hence, units indexed 7 and 12 should have

product with index (0111 XOR 1100 = 1011 =) 11.

         It\u2019s impossible to make signing completely consistent with cyclic ordering, so I\u2019d rather solve for

than worry about it. I\u2019m using the \u201Ccanonical\u201D Sedenion multiplication table, generated by unvarnished

Cayley-Dickson process, found on Tony Smith\u2019s web-site (derived, in turn, from Lohmus, Paal and Sorg-

sepp\u2019s book[8]). As will become clear toward the end, this is no mere convenience. Where zero divisors

are concerned, the assumed \u201Cequivalence\u201D of the myriad multiplication tables allowed by the imaginary

units\u2019 permutations and signings (already not quite perfect with the Octonions, as recent work by Schray

and Manogue[9] has shown) breaks down. Whether this is \u201Cbug\u201D or \u201Cfeature,\u201D why it happens, and what to

do about it, are all questions that will concern us later, but for which final answers are not yet at hand.

\u000C           In the table, the real units are rendered as signed letter U\u2019s for purposes of this tabulating chore

only. This much said, here\u2019s my Sedenion table, which readers with excess time on their hands should feel

free to test for its XOR-worthiness:

associative triples. There\u2019s but one such triple for the Quaternions, 7 for the Octonions, and 35 for the

Sedenions. These are the staff of life for all that follows, so let\u2019s stop to get acquainted with them.




                                                       Page 6
\u000C          Let\u2019s short-hand associative triples as follows: if (ab)c = a(bc), take the index numbers of these

imaginary units and write them as a comma-delimited list in parentheses, in cyclical order. The lowest

index number comes first, then the index whose product with it yields the positive value of the third. The

Quaternions\u2019 \u201Ci, j, k\u201D \u2013 almost always written as i1 , i2 , and i3 respectively \u2013 has its associative triplicity

indicated this way: (1, 2, 3). Using our Sedenion table, we can write the seven O-trips as follows:



          (1, 2, 3); (1, 4, 5); (1, 7, 6); (2, 4, 6); (2, 5, 7); (3, 4, 7); (3, 6, 5)



          It\u2019s visually obvious that only two of these triplets have counting order varying from cyclical

order: i1 x i6 = (-i7 ), and i3 x i5 = (-i6 ). (Of course, different triples are out of order in different notations.)

The other 28 associative triples in the Sedenions \u2013 the S-trips \u2013 are listed, per our table, next:



          (1, 8, 9)            (1, 11, 10)           (1, 13, 12)           (1, 14, 15)

          (2, 8, 10)           (2, 9, 11)            (2, 14, 12)           (2, 15, 13)

          (3, 8, 11)           (3, 10, 9)            (3, 15, 12)           (3, 13, 14)

          (4, 8, 12)           (4, 9, 13)            (4, 10, 14)           (4, 11, 15)

          (5, 8, 13)           (5, 12, 9)            (5, 10, 15)           (5, 14, 11)

          (6, 8, 14)           (6, 15, 9)            (6, 12, 10)           (6, 11, 13)

          (7, 8, 15)           (7, 9, 14)            (7, 13, 10)           (7, 12, 11)



          The leftmost diagram at the bottom of the next page is the \u201Ccanonical\u201D labeling of PSL(2,7) result-

ing from applying the Cayley-Dickson process. Each projective line contains 3 points (which determine

the \u201Ccircle\u201D of the Octonion 3-cycle indicated by the points\u2019 labels). The cycle in the middle (2, 4, 6) is the

only one actually appearing in this representation as a circle, although it is a \u201Cline\u201D just like the other six.

This much is true for all representations employing the triangle. The differences concern labels and arrows

only: some authors also use an XOR representation, and so keep the labeling, but change the sign of a unit,

and so change the directions of the three arrows that pass through it. Or, they change multiple units\u2019 signs,

thereby switching some other count of arrows. (But always all or none, or 3 or 4, as we\u2019ll see later on).



                                                            Page 7
\u000C          The most frequently encountered variant (used by Schray and Manogue) switches the 6\u2019s sign,

and hence reverses the ( 1 7 6 ), ( 3 6 5), ( 2 4 6 ) triplets\u2019 cycling direction, replacing them, per our earlier

convention, with ( 1 6 7), ( 3 5 6 ), and ( 2 6 4 ) respectively. This shift can be represented by simply

flipping the bottom, vertical, and circular arrows; or (as Schray and Manogue do), by rotating the two lines

that pass from 1 through 6 and 5, which thereby also reverses the arrows on the diagonals (but now labeled

3, 4, 7 and 6, 4, 2 in ascending order) as a side-effect. Then, change the orientation on the circle in the

middle and the right-hand slope to have labels and arrows properly arranged.

         The appeal of this variant is that it offers the minimum deviation from counting order in cyclically

ordered triplets: only one ( 2 6 4 ) is out of order in this labeling. But mo re extreme variations can also be

found, which are strictly combinatoric in nature. Feza Gursey, a pioneer in the study of \u201Ctheory of every-

thing\u201D models employing the exceptional Lie algebras like E6 , used a labeling system which didn\u2019t display

XORing, but did offer some analogy to tensor-indexing schemes general relativity theorists might use.

Other physicists focused on model-building with unusual algebras have also used this scheme, or \u2013 like

Susumu Okubo[10] \u2013 a sign-flipped variant (the 7 in Gursey\u2019s version has its sign reversed, yielding the

diagram in the middle at the bottom of this page.)

         Some recent work of great interest has focused on exploiting the 2- and 3-term cross-products

which are unique to the Octonions. (The familiar cross-product based on the Quaternions, and adapted

since Gibbs to \u201Cvector mechanics,\u201D has no other true analogues[11], and they also have a \u201CG2 \u201D symmetry.)




         Onar Aam and Geoffrey Dixon have been especially fond of numbering schemes based on mod-

ulo-7 arithmetic, rather than XORing, and hence don\u2019t even use the PSL(2,7) representation. Instead, they

draw triangular circuits (one per O-trip) connecting the vertices of a heptagon, as shown above.




                                                        Page 8
\u000C          The cyclicality of indices seems the major draw here. With modulo 7 arithmetic, one can avail

oneself of more than one equivalent way of representing this: ei * ei+1 = ei+5 is isomorphic to ei * ei+2 =

ei+3 , and mirror-opposite (through the vertical) to ei * ei+1 = e3 ( or ei * ei+2 = ei+6 ). By developing special

\u201CX,\u201D \u201CXY,\u201D and \u201CWXY\u201D products based upon the Octonions\u2019 cross-product structures, Dixon[12] has used

his heptagonal indices in deep studies of 16- and 24-D exotica of great interest to superstring theorists, the

closest-packing-pattern lattices of Barnes-Wall and Leech respectively. Aam, meanwhile, has done fasci-

nating work on Octonion cross-product symmetries, leading him to construct things Tony Smith calls

\u201Conarhedra\u201D \u2013 and which, I discovered near the end of writing this monograph, are 8-D isomorphs of the

\u201Cbox-kites\u201D I\u2019d independently derived from 16-D configurations of zero-divisors. (After reading this paper,

a visit to Smith\u2019s web-site is highly recommended, where the pages on Aam\u2019s \u201Ccross-product\u201D work will

show amazing correspondences \u2013 once one adjusts to notational and intuitional differences \u2013 to the entities

I\u2019ve called \u201Cstrut signatures\u201D and \u201Ctray-racks,\u201D for instance. All of which gives further confirmation of the

profundity, qua derivation algebra at least, of the \u201CG2 connection\u201D between Octonions and Sedenions.)

          The 480 different multiplication tables usually thought to be equivalent ways of working with

Octonions may seem like a lot \u2013 until one computes how many one must deal with in higher-dimensional

cases. For the Octonions, the 30 distinct combinatorial variations (up to signing) result from dividing 7! =

168 x 30 by the internal symmetry group of the finite projective plane whose labels and arrows we\u2019ve

played with \u2013 the 168-element simple group, PSL(2,7). With the Sedenions, we have to divide 15! ~ 1.24 x
  15
10     by PGL(4,2) = 8!/2 = 20,160 (the symmetry group of finite projective space), then multiply that by

                                                       15 - 4
the number of sign-flip-only possibilities: 2,048 = 2           (4 = number of generators via Cayley-Dickson

process, 3 for Octonions). The result is half a trillion . . . and these, as we\u2019ll see, are not equivalent!

          The Sedenions\u2019 indices can be placed on the 15 vertices of the finite projective tetrahedron with

35 lines of 3 points each, one per triplet, 7 lines intersecting in each point and 3 planes in each line, imply-

ing 1 Octonion triangle + its 7 lines x (2 \u2013 1) distinct planes through each = 15 planes isomorphic to the

PSL(2,7) triangle. The picture is from p. 139 of Lohmu s et al., where it found its way to Tony Smith\u2019s

web-site, where I first encountered it. But mostly, working with triplets directly will seem far more natural

and easy.

\u000C         While Moreno generates his G2 analysis in the usual \u201Ctop-down\u201D manner, giving but one instance

of an actual zero-divisor pair in his paper, my own bias is toward \u201Cbottom-up\u201D constructivism. The process

of creating actual zero-divisor pairs will occupy us next. Our short-term goal will be to provide all things

necessary for revealing the 42 Assessors, proving their completeness, and generating \u201CGoTo lists\u201D for the

seven O-trips which will provide necessary and sufficient kindling to spark all this. (We\u2019ll see, too, that all

but seven of the S-trips are included in passing \u2013 three in fact, per O-trip GoTo list. The exclusion of seven

others from all such lists will be proven by our \u201CBehind the Eight-Ball Theorem\u201D late in our construction

work, and will motivate another tabulation, the \u201COsiris Partition,\u201D from which box kites will fly.)

\u000C{ II } Creating Something from Nothing (Three Production Rules):

    Quartets of imaginary units written per the notational conventions given above form valid zero-

dividing pairs if the following obtains:



    (A, B) x (C, D) = 0 \u00F3 (A xor C) \u2013 (D xor B) = (A xor D) \u2013 (C xor B) = 0.



    Alternatively, given the correlation between signing and left-right orientation as one moves in

sequence in an associative triplet\u2019s 3-cycle, we could just as readily write the above rule this way:



    (A, B) x (C, D) = 0 \u00F3 (A xor C) + (B xor D) = (A xor D) + (B xor C) = 0.



    In the realm of the Octonions, only trivial cases entailing null or non-distinct letters can occur. This is

certainly connected to the fact that each of the seven Octonion triplets has exactly one unit in common with

any other triplet. Translating this into conditions among Sedenions is not immediately obvious, however.

First, any product like the above implies six different triplets, since each Sedenion index pair belongs to the

triplet containing its XOR product. Hence, A and B form a triplet with A xor B = X, while C and D form

another with C xor D = Y. Moreover, the requirements just given mandate that two pairs among the six

must necessarily share a term each: (A, C) and (B, D) share some E; (A, D) and (B, C) share some F.

    In fact, we can say more than this. Since the Octonions and their copies contain but seven imaginary

units, and the explicit requirements for zero-dividing already exhaust six, then:

    Lemma: Given two Co-Assessors (A, B) and (C, D), A xor B and C xor D have the same index G.

    This clearly implies that the units involved in multiplication can be arranged in both Assessors so that

(A xor B ) - ( C xor D) = 0, without effect on the end result. This \u201Caxiom of choice\u201D will be of great use in

the proof behind our second production rule. For the moment, though, we provide, prove, and apply

    Production Rule #1 (\u201CThree-Ring Circuits\u201D). Given a pair of Co-Assessors (A, B) and (C, D), a new

Assessor ( E, F ), mutually zero-dividing with both its progenitors, can be created by assigning the new

letters to the two distinct XOR\u2019s ( A xor D = C xor B; A xor C = D xor B ).

    Proof: Do the zero-dividing arithmetic, keeping track of the triplet cycles as they reveal themselves.

    [B xor C = ] + F        + E [ = B xor D ]            => ( B, C, F ); ( B, D, E )

    [A xor C = ] \u2013 E         \u2013 F[ = A xor D ]            => ( D, A, F ); ( C, A, E )

                        0



    Now, substituting from the associative triplets listed to the right, form products of ( E + F ) with the

initiating Co-Assessors, allowing for unknown signing via the \u201Csg\u201D variable:



         E    + sg F                                               E    + sg F

         A     +    B                                              C    +    D

         - D - sg C                                                + B - sg A

         + C + sg D                                                - A + sg B

         0 \u00F3 sg = (+1)                                             0 \u00F3 sg = (-1)



    Clearly, exactly one of these must be true for fixed sg. By moving sg between lines of a product, it is

obvious that we get a collection of six distinct product-pairs involving ( A + B ), ( C + D) , and ( E + F ).

As we make zero by multiplying the Assessors in some sequence, we are forced to switch from DOS to

UNIX paths in one of two cross-over sequences, the knot theorist\u2019s trefoil (dduddu), or else the \u201Cunknot\u201D of

a \u201Ctriple zigzag\u201D (dududu). In the GoTo Listings, the first of each O-trip\u2019s 4 columns displays, in 3 conse-

cutive lines, the first half of its sole zigzag\u2019s 6-cycle; the other 3 columns show the 3 trefoil couplings.

    Dynamic Content. Whether trefoil or zigzag, the dynamics are analogous \u2013 and require adapting the

usual exponential power-orbit to the special requirements of their nonassociative (and even non-alternative)

world. The complex domain\u2019s exp(ix) = cos x + i*sin y requires various \u201Ccorrection terms\u201D to work in less

orderly settings. An Assessor\u2019s pair of imaginaries indexed ( A + B ) can\u2019t simply be recast as exp( iA )

(cos x + iC sin y), A xor C = + B, with a Co-Assessor indexed ( D + E ) being recast similarly. For the

zero to show in the product, the sine and cosine terms in the right-hand parentheses must evaluate last.



                                                     Page 12
\u000C         The simplest way to guarantee this is by fiat: define a \u201Czip\u201D (Zero-divisor Indigenous Power-

orbit) function. Ignoring internal signing for simplicity, for Assessor indices ( A, B ) and ( C, D ), and

angular variables x and y, write products of the circular motions in the two Assessor planes like this:



    zip( A, B; x ) * zip( C, D; y )   = ( cos x * iA + sin x * iB ) * ( cos y * iC + sin y * iD )

                                      = ( cos ( x + y ) * i[A xor C] ) + ( sin ( x \u2013 y ) * i[D xor A] )




    We know, from our first production rule, how to interpret this: two currents with opposite clockwise

senses or \u201Cchirality,\u201D spawned by angular \u201Ccurrents\u201D in two Co-Assessors\u2019 planes, manifest as alternately

con- and de- structive wave interference effects, in the plane spanned by the third Assessor they mutually

zero-divide. In this \u201Ctoy model,\u201D patterns readily recognizable as Lissajous figures would sweep through

the origin, \u201Cshowing on the oscilloscope\u201D in accordance with the opposing currents\u2019 relative velocities

(provided, of course, their ratio only involved small integers).

    This is, of course, vastly simplified: just one Co-Assessor trio\u2019s interactions require considering six

dimensions of toroidal \u201Cplumbing,\u201D and Assessors can interact directly in two different trios, and indirectly

receive or transmit \u201Cpass-along currents\u201D in ways that will require separate study. By the end of the present

investigation, we will have sufficient information to enable the framing of such studies, but insufficient

space to contemplate them further in these pages.

    One point, though, must be made now: thanks to Peixoto\u2019s Theorem[13] (well known to dynamicists,

not well known to high-energy physicists), we know that stable flow-patterns on a torus can only be gener-

ated by pairs of oppositely oriented currents with same rational winding number \u2013 clearly suggesting that

zero-divisor dynamics in the badlands of Sedenion space could provide the basis for a surprising new kind

of orderliness! (Consider the unpromising mix of dispersion and nonlinearity, yielding the supreme stabili-

ty of soliton waves.) To see how naturally this condition can be met, let\u2019s make our \u201Ctoy model\u201D a bit more

robust. Show the full 6-cycle, assume noncommutativity implies two helically distinct routes through the

cycle, and think of them as generated by a \u201Cvolley and serve\u201D logic. (That is, the helices \u201Cconverse,\u201D with

the (A,B)-plane-initiated \u201Cping\u201D inducing a (C,D)-plane-based \u201Cpong\u201D in some \u201Cdt\u201D less than the time it

takes for one full wind around the torus.) Here\u2019s \u201Cdt\u201D-free for-instances of what this could look like:

         It must be noted, as a caveat, that generalizations of Peixoto\u2019s Theorem beyond the 2-torus are

nontrivial, and even problematic in many contexts. But the possibilities in the present case seem so

beautiful that, barring solid evidence to the contrary, pessimism feels too difficult to sustain.

         Two final notes: the ping/pong \u201Cdt\u201D is the natural condition for allowing quantization, and as long

as we expect responses to multiplicative acts are not immediate, we can readily construct toroidal flows in a

dynamic \u201Cbeneath\u201D quantization which are stable in at least the limited 2-torus context. Later, we\u2019ll see

that there are 28 \u201CCoAssessor Trios,\u201D which suggests a link to the \u201828\u2019 of the D4 Lie algebra which, via

\u201Ctriality,\u201D can underwrite an enormous array of quantized structures. In the \u201Chyperdiamond lattice\u201D ap-

proach \u2013 an alternative or complement to the \u201Csuperstring\u201D theoretics that garner most of the press, linked

with the work of David Finkelstein and Tony Smith and their students \u2013 the D4 focus is paramount in many

respects. And, as one can readily discover by browsing his website, Smith has suggested its connection to

the 28 \u201CS-trips\u201D in the Sedenions. I would suggest here that a deeper connection to the Sedenions may be

found through the CoAssessor Trios \u2013 which brings up my second point.

         The \u201Ctriality\u201D among zero-divisors forming a Trio has crucial elements not like the 2-torus at all \u2013

or at least not like it in any obvious way. What family of functions A, B, C and/or D, E, F can effect some

kind of circuit in a Trio\u2019s 6-cycle, returning to some analog of \u201Cstart-up mode\u201D? Or (analogous to Fourier

series), can create a cycle which will behave as if we\u2019d had it as our starting point, irrespective of what sort

of messiness the resonance emerged from? What fourfold function families can be envisioned for circuits

involving quartets of zero-divisors (which we\u2019ll be calling \u201Ctray-racks\u201D later)? Can some dense set of such

constructs be built upon a Peixoto-style \u201Cbedrock\u201D of 2-torus stable flows, or are things far wackier than

this? Do we need a dynamic model based on \u201Cquick-hit\u201D interventions and stably regulated jumps, akin to

the needle-sticking redirecting of the flow of chi in acupuncture?

\u000C     Production Rule #2 (\u201CSkew-Symmetric Twisting\u201D). Given Co-Assessors (A, B) and (C, D), precisely

two new Assessors, unable to be Co-Assessors with either propagator but Co-Assessors with each other,

can be created by exchanging one lettered unit from within one Assessor\u2019s parentheses with one from the

other, then flipping the sign associated with one or the other unit in the resultant.

     Preliminary Remarks. Since exchanging A and D is effectively indistinguishable from exchanging B

and C, the four possible pair-swaps reduce to but two. Without loss of generality, we can then say that the

restriction to \u201Cprecisely one\u201D means either ( A + D )( C \u2013 B ) or ( D + B )( C \u2013 A ) = 0, but not both.

     Proof. By the earlier lemma, we can arrange the writing order of the terms in the parentheses of the

two Co-Assessors we apply the rule to so that the XOR\u2019s of the terms internal to the parentheses have

opposite sign. That is, for ( A + B )( C + D ), we arrange our labeling so that A xor B = + G, and C xor D =

- G. This gives O*-trip sequences ( A, B, G ) and ( D, C, G ) respectively. (Note: write O*- and not O-

trip, as we are necessarily dealing with an Octonion copy! All but one of the O*-trips within it will, of

necessity, be S-trips and hence not be contained within the list of seven O-trips proper given earlier. More

on this later!)

     Maintaining the same notation otherwise as with our prior proof for Production Rule #1, yields the

other O*-trip sequences: ( B, C, F ) and ( D, A, F ); and ( B, D, E ) and ( C, A, E ). Let\u2019s do the arithmetic:



          C - B                                           C - A

          A + D                                           D + B

          +G + E                                         +F + G

          -E - G                                         +G - F

              0                                             2G



     Clearly, the left-hand product is generated by a new pair of Assessors. Just as clearly, products of

either with either generator will result in real units, since each got one letter each from each propagator. In

normed units, the \u201C2G\u201D result in the right-hand product reduces in fact to plus or minus the normed

imaginary unit produced by the internal XOR-ing described above.




                                                     Page 15
\u000C    These two production rules can be combined in two ways. First, Rule #1 can be run on the results of

Rule #2. But also, Rule #2 can be run on the results of Rule #1! This means successive applications of the

two rules turn two Assessors into twelve . . . a result strong enough to require a

    Proof. No checking is needed for each Assessor pair before the Twisting and that created after it. We

need, though, to check that results of the three Twistings do not duplicate each other ( 3 x 2 = 6 tests), and

do not recreate the third Assessor related to each Twisting\u2019s propagating pair by Production Rule #1. By

shared letters, the six Assessors created by Twisting, can each only require testing for distinctness against

one of each of the two other Twistings\u2019 Co-Assessor pairs, which means ( 3 x 4 )/2 = 6 separate tests. So

12 tests in all are called for to complete the proof, which symmetry can reduce to 6. Consider the Twisting

of ( A + B ) with ( E \u2013 F), which produces ( A - F ) and ( E - B ). Test both against ( C + D ); ( A - F )

against ( C \u2013 B ) and ( E + D ); and, ( E - B ) against ( A + D ) and ( C + F ).

    We choose this Twisting to examine, because it completes the full mapping of the Octonion copy by

resolving the seventh O*-trip we know must exist in such a copy. We know ( A, B, G ), and this Assessor

pair requires this to be negated by E xor F. Therefore, the seventh O*-trip reads: ( E, G, F ). For conveni-

ence, all seven O*-trips in our O-copy are collected together now:



    ( A, B, G ); ( A, E, C ); ( A, F, D ); ( B, C, F ); ( B, D, E ); ( C, G, D ); ( E, G, F )



    Here\u2019s a sequence of six quick calculations to conclude the proof:

( A \u2013 F )( C + D ) = ( \u2013 E \u2013 F + B \u2013 A ) FAILS!             ( E \u2013 B )( C + D ) = ( + A \u2013 B \u2013 F \u2013 E ) FAILS!

( A \u2013 F )( C \u2013 B ) = ( \u2013 E \u2013 G + B + C ) FAILS!             ( A \u2013 F )( E + D ) = ( + C \u2013 F \u2013 G \u2013 A ) FAILS!

( E \u2013 B )( A+ D ) = ( \u2013 C \u2013 B + G \u2013 E ) FAILS!              ( E \u2013 B )( C + F ) = ( + A \u2013 G \u2013 F + C ) FAILS!



    Masochists who won\u2019t take \u201Carguments by symmetry\u201D at face value are encouraged to spend a minute

or two crunching out three more lines of calculations. They may also enjoy playing with the four-unit

products resulting from all failed results. Each includes precisely two terms from its producers, and, with

norming assumed, they are all in fact square roots of minus unity, as can be checked quite quickly. (All




                                                        Page 16
\u000Ccross-products among the four letters cancel, the squares of the units sum to \u20134 within the parentheses, and

the norming of the producing terms mandates the coefficient of the parenthesized listings above be \u00BD.)

    After a little playing around like this, though, an earlier failure should return to your thoughts, which

also resulted in an Imaginary (instead of pregnantly Empty) result. What was it about the second possible

Twist result that made it fail? This is related, of course, to our exercising the free choice our earlier lemma

showed was our prerogative. And perhaps it is related to another fact tossed off in a parenthetical remark a

few lines back. Of the seven O*-trips in an Octonion copy, only (and exactly) one can actually be an O-trip

proper . . . belong, that is, to the genuine Octonions (index < 8 ) prior to their extension to Sedenions.

    Let\u2019s mull on this for a minute, beginning our thinking with a new convention. To always be clear

which units have index > 7 (pure Sedenions), we will use letter variables that are Upper Case only, such as

\u2018S\u2019; correspondingly, pure Octonions will be written exclusively with lower case lettering (\u2018o\u2019). No copy

O* of the genuine Octonions can be all S\u2019s, for the XOR of any two will produce a Zero in the leftmost bit,

and hence result in an o. Ditto, all o\u2019s means the genuine O, hence no division by Zero. But one of each

mandates two of each by XORing (o xor S = some S\u2019; S xor S\u2019 = some o\u2019), and two o\u2019s have a third as

product, completing an O-trip.

    The third o, when XORing with S and S\u2019, must produce at least one new S, call it S\u2019\u2019. Suppose the

first o forms an associative triple with S and S\u2019. Then either o\u2019 or o\u2019\u2019 must form an S-trip with two S\u2019s

distinct from both of these. This leaves us with 3 o\u2019s and 4 S\u2019s, which completes the O*. But suppose o\u2019

does not form an associative triple with S and S\u2019. Then either o\u2019 or o\u2019\u2019 must form an S-trip with them

instead, which leads to the same result. Hence, any O* not identically the genuine O must have 3 o\u2019s and 4

S\u2019s exactly.

    Our Co-Assessor pairs explicitly require writing with four letters. All four cannot be o\u2019s, lest we be in

the genuine O. We cannot have one o or S, and three S\u2019s or o\u2019s, lest multiplying require an S xor o to equal

an S xor S or an o xor o, which is impossible if we\u2019re to end up with Zero. So either all must be S\u2019s (which

we\u2019ll see is impossible); or, we must have two of each.

    Suppose the latter is the case. Then we can have it two ways: (1) the o\u2019s are combined to make one

Assessor, and the S\u2019s, the other; or, (2) an Assessor must have one of each. Regardless of which case we

start with, the two possible Twists the proof of Production Rule #2 required we test (swapping terms on the




                                                     Page 17
\u000Csame or opposite sides of the middle + or -) will result in exactly one case of each Co-Assessor pairing.

And we know that exactly one of their multiplications must always fail. Which suggests the

     \u201CExogamous Moieties\u201D Rule. It is forbidden for the two letters on either side of an Assessor\u2019s central

\u2018+\u2019 or \u2018-\u2019 to belong to the only O-trip among an O-copy\u2019s seven associative triplets. Put another way, the

two units whose marriage constitutes an Assessor must belong to different halves or \u201Cmoieties\u201Dof the

Sedenion tribe. One must be a pure Octonion or \u2018o\u2019; the other must be a pure Sedenion or \u2018S\u2019.

     Proof. Consider the ways of picking two units. If moiety didn\u2019t matter, then other things being equal,

there should be (7x6)/(2x1) = 21 possibilities. Picking 2 of 3 o\u2019s can happen 3 ways; picking 2 of 4 S\u2019s,

(4x3)/(1x2) = 6 ways; and picking one of each can be accomplished 3x4 = 12 ways, which three options

tally, of course, to 21. But we have found precisely 12 Assessors linked to any given O-trip. Moreover,

without even knowing actual index numbers for any actual cases yet, we can write them out abstractly and

catch the pattern anyway. Writing each Co-Assessor triple in a separate column, we have this array:



          ( A, B )            ( A, G )            ( A, D )            ( A, F )

          ( C, D )            ( C, F )            ( C, B )            ( C, G )

          ( E, F )            ( E, D )            ( E, G )            ( E, B )



     If our assertion be true, then A, C, E are an O-trip (and should be written \u201Ca, c, e\u201D by our casing con-

vention). In the first test of Production Rule #2, it was ( A, C ) ( D, B ) which failed. Rewritten to show

casing, this is ( a, c ) ( D, B ), confirming our hypothesis. Moreover, twisting ( A, B ) ( E, F ) fails for the

( a, e ) ( B, F ) product only; likewise, ( C, D ) ( E, F ) has ( c, e ) ( D, F ) as a failed twist product. And

easy calculations show this obtains with the three other columns as well.

     The last possibility for failure of the proof is the four-S case, which we\u2019d placed to the side. And how-

ever we form an instance of it, all four XOR products must be o\u2019s. But then \u201CExogamous Moieties\u201D must

be invoked, and so the First Production Rule must fail, which contradicts the claim we have a Co-Assessor

pair in the first place. Q.E.D.

\u000Cthe labels by making use of the last theorem in Moreno\u2019s paper (the solitary corollary of which is his \u201CG2

homomorphism\u201D result). Put simply, he proves that if we have two units a, b which associate, and a third

we label y which anti-associates with them \u2013 ( ay )b = \u2013 a( yb ), in other words \u2013 then a, b and y provide

necessary and sufficient material for spawning a copy of the Octonions. A mapping from (a,y,b)-generated

terms to the Octonion index set is made by this sequence of assignments:



                                  ( a, b, ab, (ay)b, yb, ay, y ) \u00E8 ( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 )



    Let\u2019s set the O-trip ( A E C ) from our proof apparatus to be ( a, b, ab ); and, let\u2019s pick D for our y.

Plugging in the rest of our letters into the mapping machinery gives us these assignments:



         ( a, b, ab, (ay)b, yb, ay, y ) \u00E8 ( A, E, C, -G, B, -F, D ) \u00E8 ( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 )



    To give this a test drive, let\u2019s stuff some numbers. Pick ( a, b, c ) to be the Quaternions\u2019 ( 1, 2, 3 ) and

then search the GoTo Listings until we get a Co-Assessor Trio associated with this O-trip which induces

minimal signing messiness when we run it through the steps of our proofs. Here\u2019s the result:



    ( 1 + 14 )( 3 + 12 ) = ( 3 + 12 )( 2 \u2013 13 ) = 0 \u00E8 ( A + B )( C + D ) = ( C + D )( E \u2013 F ) = 0



    All that\u2019s missing is G, but since AB = FE = G, G must be 15. That means we get this map:



                             ( 1, 2, 3, \u201315, 14, \u201313, 12 ) \u00E8 ( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 )



    Since all GoTo Listings for a given O-trip share the same quartet of Sedenion units, the \u201CO-copies\u201D

associated with each of the four O-trip\u2019s four Co-Assessor trios will employ the same (albeit differently

signed) units in their mappings. Hence the Listings refer not to an automorphism, but an \u201Cautomorpheme\u201D

(e.g., set of \u201Cconstituent units,\u201D as they say in structural linguistics, from which an actual Co-Assessor trio\u2019s

automorphisms are generated) when listing the seven imaginaries from which O-copies are made.



                                                         Page 19
\u000C    There is a secondary reason for introducing this subtle distinction: while we do, in fact, have copies of

the Octonions, and hence O-copies in the sense used above, the \u201Cisomorphism\u201D Moreno depends upon in

fact entails a crucial loss of information. If we take the mapping just provided and generate the constituent

O-trips for the terms on the right of the arrow, we\u2019ll see they don\u2019t quite match the S-trips which spawned

the listing on the left. We have, in fact, two signing conflicts.

    ( 3, 4, 7 ) maps to ( 3, \u201315, 12 ) ~ ( 3, 12, 15 ). Our Sedenion table shows the S-trip as ( 3, 15, 12 ).

    ( 3, 6, 5 ) maps to ( 3, \u201313, 14 ) ~ ( 3, 14, 13 ). Our Sedenion table shows the S-trip as ( 3, 13, 14 ).

    This is a possibility which Moreno apparently didn\u2019t consider: indeed, the only concrete instance he

offers of his \u201Cspecial triples\u201D theorem is, perversely, one which has no zero-divisors: a, b, y = 1, 2, 7 . . .

which generates not an O-copy, but the Octonions proper! Moreover, the signing conflict cannot be re-

moved by permuting the signs on the underlying units. This is best checked on the Octonion side of the

mapping, as there are only 480 equivalent multiplication tables. These partition into 30 combinatorially

different placements on the PSL(2,7) triangle with same signing, times 16 identically labeled, differently

signed, placements. The XOR requirement made at the onset restricts us completely as to combinatorial

varying. We are, therefore, restricted to the 16 signing variants. But these in fact can be reduced by half,

since each multiplication table has an \u201Copposite\u201D table with all arrows reversed.

    We are down, then, to eight variants, each of which is generated by changing the sign on at least one

unit, and hence the orientation of the 3 arrows which pass through it. But we needn\u2019t look at any of them

explicitly, since the fact that any two O-trips share precisely one unit is all we need to know to prove this

    Lemma. Permuting signs on units changes 3 or 4 arrows, or all or none.

    Proof. Changing one unit\u2019s sign flips 3 arrows. Changing any two flips 6 \u2013 2 = 4 arrows (since sign-

change is an involution, the O-trip with both units is left unchanged). Changing all 3 members of an O-trip

changes all arrows (the O-trip in question is flipped thrice = once; all other O-trips share but one, so get one

flip). Changing all 4 units not in some O-trip changes no arrows (the excluded O-trip is left untouched, and

all others are toggled twice). Changing 3 ( = 4 \u2013 1 ) units which are not an O-trip therefore changes 3. By

duality of opposite multiplication tables (there being but 7 units), this exhausts all possibilities.

    Throwaway Corollary. Since the \u201Ccanonical\u201D Octonion multiplication table has two O-trips with

cyclical and counting order differing, a table with all O-trips in order in both senses is impossible.

\u000C    Implication. Moreno\u2019s \u201Cisomorphism\u201D between Sedenion subsets which act like O-copies in their

Sedenion context, and systems of units which are multiplicatively equivalent to the Octonions, is only

partial, and breaks down where signing of units (and hence orienting of O-trips) of a true Octonion multi-

plication table is concerned. Moreno\u2019s \u201Cisomorphism\u201D also doesn\u2019t capture sign-related information that\u2019s

clearly germane to Co-Assessor Trios. (\u201CHomomorphism to G2 ,\u201D where roots or \u201Czeros\u201D are concerned,

says nothing about the sign-based distinction between zigzags and trefoils: it merely points to the existence

of \u201Cdistinct\u201D 6-cycle orbits of some kind \u2013 and it\u2019s even ambiguous about what \u201Cdistinct\u201D means, since not

just our second production rule, but the third we\u2019ll see next, could claim, for different reasons, to define it.)

    Moral: Tools derived from Lie algebra shouldn\u2019t be assumed to work as planned with things that are

not Lie algebras. When determining laws about apples from the study of oranges, concrete data should at

least be looked at before claiming they fit the facts! (Else there may be hell to pay later, as we\u2019ll find out!)

This much said, here, then, are some further facts: the two mis -signed triplets are not due to a \u201Cmistake\u201D by

Moreno, they also are built in to the abstract \u201Cletter logic\u201D of our proofs (readers are encouraged to test this

out for themselves). More peculiar still, all the mis -signed triplets are the same triplets, regardless of what

Sedenions or O-trips are used to feed Moreno\u2019s mapping machine. Further, all excluded Sedenions (and

jump ahead to the \u201C8-Ball Theorem\u201D to see just what this means) generate \u201Cnormal\u201D Octonion multiplica-

tion tables. These are computable facts, whose underlying reasons we leave, for now, as mysteries.

This table was built by listing the 7 associative Octonion triplets in ascending cyclic order, then populating
the first column in each such O-trip\u2019s \u201CGoTo Listing\u201D with the first 3 Co-Assessor pairings in its unique
\u201Ctriple zigzag\u201D Trio\u2019s 6-cycle. (The cycle\u2019s last 3 pairings are identical but for internal signing.) The 1st,
2nd , and 3rd rows in the 2nd , 3rd and 4th columns are the zigzag\u2019s same-rowed (L, R) to (\u2013R, L) Twist results.
Twists based on other (trefoil) columns are (L,R) to (R, \u2013L). The bottom row of the 2nd column\u2019s Twist is
on the 3rd column\u2019s bottom, with Twists in other columns likewise on a diagonal, but oppositely oriented
with respect to movements up or down the 6-cycle. The Twists for the 3rd and 4th columns, meanwhile,
mirror the orientations just described for the 1st and 2nd columns, respectively. There is a \u201Cmusical round\u201D
aspect to trefoils, too, one of the 3 Twists for columns 2, 3, 4 requiring its target (column 4, 2, 3) be rolled
forward half a cycle. 6-cycle x 4 columns x 7 O-trips = 168 Co-Assessor couplings = PSL(2,7)\u2019s order.



                                                     Page 22
\u000C     We now know that for each of the 7 O-trips there are 12 Assessors, one for each pairing of the three O-

trip letters and the four O-copy Sedenions. By symmetry, the 6 pairings among these latter four units must

form S-trips, and in such a manner that two uniquely match with each O-trip unit.

     But each o appears in 3 automorphemes, while at the same time belonging to (28)/(7) = 4 distinct S-

trips. The 6 S-trips containing the common o cannot, therefore, be distinct. But any one of 3 automor-

phemes sharing an o must share an S-trip with one of the others; moreover, it cannot share its other S-trip

containing that o with that same automorpheme, lest they share their O-trip and be isomorphic.

     Applying this to each pair we can pick among the three automorphemes sharing an o, leads to this

     Lemma. Any two of the 3 automorphemes generating GoTo listings, and sharing an Octonion, share

exactly 2 Sedenions, with the 2 each excludes from the other being shared with the third one. An obvious

corollary is

     Production Rule #3. The unique automorpheme which shares the o and S of another\u2019s Assessor will

also contain that Assessor, and be the only distinct automorpheme to do so in the whole Sedenion space.

Suppose, in the first instance, the O-trip for Assessor ( a + B ) is ( a, c, e ) and in the second, is ( a, m, n).

We can solve for the Co-Assessors of the two ( a + B ) instances we know exist in the second case by

setting up the usual XOR apparatus. Plug in either new O-trip unit and solve for the missing S, like this:



     ( a + B )( m + sg S ) \u00F3 a xor sg S = m xor B; [ a xor m = ]n = sg S xor B.



     Applying the other production rules to the resultant Assessor coupling yields some surprises: systems

of Assessor triplicities emerge, filling the vertex structure (but only half the eight sides) of an octahedral

array. These arrangements of alternating \u201Csails\u201D and \u201Cvents\u201D are called box-kites in what follows. To

properly appreciate them, we have one more mystery to unravel.

     From our last lemma, it\u2019s clear that the 3 automorphemes P, Q, R sharing the same o collectively use

up 6 of the possible 8 S\u2019s. However they are labeled, P will share 2 of its 4 S\u2019s with Q and the other 2 with

R. And this is true for all automorphemes containing zero-divisors, and sharing an o: any 3 among the 7

O-trips with an o in common will therefore obey this distribution rule. In each case, there must be an S

which is explicitly excluded, and XORing between it and the 3 O-trip units will generate the other 3




                                                       Page 23
\u000Cexcludes. Is the same S excluded in all cases? Looking now at the table, the evidence is clearly yes, which

leads to our

     \u201CBehind the 8-Ball Theorem\u201D. No automorpheme which can be used to produce Assessors can con-

tain the index-8 Sedenion.

    The table shows the \u201C8-Ball\u201D theorem as clearly as a proof: for GoTo #1, the O-trip is (1,2,3), and the

exclude list is {8, 8+1, 8+2, 8+3}; for GoTo #2, the O-trip is (1,4,5), and the exclude list is { 8, 8+1, 8+4,

8+5 } . . . and so on. The reason for this mysterious behavior is very simple. The lower three bits of the 8-

Ball are 000, making it the identity of the group of XOR operations among the Octonions\u2019 indices \u2013 the

role exclusively enacted by the Real unit among the Octonions in their own domain. Hence, 8 xor o, o any

Octonion index, will always be 8 + o. As any o belongs to 3 O-trips, whose units include all the Octonions,

clearly no XORing with any other Sedenion could hope to satisfy the unit-exclusion requirements for all 7

O-trips. Indeed, for any Octonion o, none but 8 and 8 + o could do so for all three O-trips sharing it! Yet

this is the minimum required, given the share-and-exclude symmetry discussed above.

    The collection of seven 4-D spheres, or \u201Cballs,\u201D consisting of Quaternion copies based on the S-trip

made by any o and the index-8 Sedenion, is the only such set not riven by Zero-Dividing \u201Cslash planes.\u201D

(Not just lines, since any real coefficients attached to Zero-Dividing axes yield points which Zero-Divide

                                                                               N                     N
each other.) This concretizes a result of Moreno\u2019s (Zero-Dividers span 2 -4 dimensions in 2 \u2013dimensional

imaginary realms, N > 3) and suggests a unit-based table to make \u201Cbox-kites\u201D easy to derive.

    The slash-free image of the 8-Ball further suggests the Egyptian myth of Osiris, who was hacked into

14 \u201Cunits\u201D by his evil brother Set, leaving his wife and sister Isis with the Humpty-Dumpty work. The next

table, then, is called the Osiris Partition, and shows the labels for the 7 Octonion units running down the

left, with those for the 7 viable Sedenions running across the top. The main diagonal is all null. The other

42 cells each show all four appearances, in Co-Assessor trios, of the Assessor whose indices label the cell.

These are indicated by a pair of GoTo Numbers, each linked to the two Co-Assessors\u2019 indices.

    The process of converting data from the Osiris Partition into box-kite drawings is a lot like a \u201CKnight\u2019s

Tour\u201D problem. Here, the game board is 7x7 instead of the usual 8x8 used in chess, but the logic is similar.

Pick a square, and write the cell\u2019s o and S numbers in parentheses as vertex labels on a triangle. In the

triangle\u2019s center, put the GoTo Number. The pair of Assessor coordinates, listed in the cell with the GoTo



                                                       Page 24
\u000CNumber, go on the triangle\u2019s other corners. Attach another triangle, bow-tie fashion, to the first, put the

second GoTo Number inside, and label its free vertices with the other Assessors\u2019 indices. Jump to the cell

of an Assessor whose indices you\u2019ve put on a corner, and repeat the process until you complete a \u201Ctour.\u201D

You won\u2019t hit all squares, but you will get an octahedral vertex figure (in one of seven ways).

         We will take a close look at these \u201Cbox kites\u201D in the next section. Before we begin to examine

them, the reader should consider their duals, the septet of \u201CDunkin\u2019 Donuts\u201D implicit in the remarks made at

the bottom of the GoTo Listings table. Each 6-cycle by 4-trio array can be made into wallpaper, with the

contrasting up and down rhythms of the Twist results vis \u00E0 vis cycling direction leading to a natural repre-

sentation as a toroidal two-flow system: the dunked donut moves down, the coffee\u2019s sucked up. While 6-

cycling joins Assessors as vertices on box-kites, twisting joins up edges that link Co-Assessors, forming

torus maps: draw a square and its diagonals, placing four Assessors from the same GoTo List and with the

same o in the middle; put the four Assessors sharing the O-trip\u2019s second o in pairs at North and South; put

the last four Assessors, sharing the third o, in pairs at West and East. Each half-diagonal is a join of two

edges which are each other\u2019s Twist product; each edge of the square is likewise pasted to its opposite num-

ber, making the torus. Each of the four triangles defines a Co-Assessor trio residing on a different box-kite.

         Neither box-kites nor dunkin\u2019 donuts can facilitate a complete Knight\u2019s Tour; but by playing these

two dual systems off each other (like veins and arteries? Right brain, left brain? Ida and Pingala? Yin and

Yang?), such a tour is readily conducted \u2013 even if there is no \u201Cgroup structure\u201D to make the job description

obvious!

         We can take leave of the Assessors proper and consider their ensembles with Production Rule #0

(\u201CSeinfeld Production\u201D). Pick a random Octonion unit o (7 ways), then a random pure Sedenion which

isn\u2019t the 8-Ball or its XOR with o (6 ways); the rest follows. Or pick a random non-index-8 Sedenion (7

ways), then any o whose index isn\u2019t the XOR of that Sedenion with 8 ( 6 ways ); yadda, yadda, yadda.

\u000C{ III } Box-Kites, Lanyards, and Strut Signatures:

         The Lie algebraist\u2019s toolkit is the historical result of assimilation of imaginary units and their pro-

geny into the orthodoxy of Number. As this century\u2019s countless failures to deal with bare charge, raw sin-

gularities of caustics, and so forth, make clear, the adjunction of Zero made by late medieval accountants to

the realm of number still hasn\u2019t been fully integrated into the general population of arithmetical entities.

Which makes concrete immersion in the actual phenomena being thought about all the more critical if real

progress is to be made in understanding them.

         The construction and \u201Cflying\u201D of box-kites will take us a large step past these impasses. Let\u2019s start

with the image of a \u201Cmock octahedron.\u201D In one G2 view, they belong to a set of 7 isomorphic objects. In

another, each organizes 12 sets of entities into two same-sized classes. An Assessor sits on each of the 6

vertices, each composed of two distinct lines which only zero-divide in different contexts. The vertices are

all at unit distance from the origin, and have a square frame, and so on. But, due to the \u201Cquadruple cover-

ing\u201D needed to accommodate +( A + B ) at each, only the eight pyramids formed by each face and the ori-

gin are truly isomorphic (via \u201Cpiecewise congruence\u201D) with a 3-D octahedron. The need, while circuiting

along pathways joining mutually zero-dividing points, to flip from DOS to UNIX paths requires a certain

trompe d\u2019oeil (analogous to the hot-swapping of hard drives in a multi-protocol machine) if we\u2019re to keep

the illusion going. For when these pieces are spliced together in 12-D, vertices on opposite ends of any of

the three axes are a mere edge-distance apart \u2013 an Escher-like impossibility in 3-D!

         The box-kite image (and octahedral box-kites are hardly unlikely) actually conveys some deep

information, albeit by analogy. Call the four triangles which come from our O-trip tables \u201Csails,\u201D and the

four situated between them so as to prevent any two sails from sharing an edge \u201Cvents.\u201D In everyday

spacetime, sails are 2-D sheets of silk or mylar, say, while vents allow passage of the 4-D object called

wind. The situation here is remarkably akin. Our sails live in copies of the 8-D Octonions; the Assessor

trios we call vents, though, require the full 16-D of \u201CSedenion wind\u201D to operate in (which, as with real-

world kites, is double the dimensionality of the sails).

         The box-kite also has structural features which correspond to new relations among Assessors. The

square frames (one per each of the three axis pairings) are a new kind of arrangement that can\u2019t exist within

the confines of an O-copy, yet which are as dynamically legitimate as the trios who comprise the sails and



                                                     Page 27
\u000Cvents. Even the struts have meaning for us, since they serve to keep diagonally opposite Assessors apart

(such pairs don\u2019t zero-divide), while at the same time letting them work as higher-order components (the 4-

unit additive sum of Assessors at opposite corners is itself a zero-divisor . . . and the three such composites

derived one from each strut form a Co-Assessor trio).

         To get started, we need some new diagramming logic \u2013 something like one might find, say, in the

theory of directed graphs \u2013 to streamline our picture of how Assessors interact. And we also need to con-

ceive some new kind of entity to formally encapsulate what these interactions comprise. As our aim is to

domesticate Zero, the decimal system place-holder, let\u2019s call it a \u201Clanyard,\u201D the string that serves as a place-

holder for beads, charms, and other trinkets when building a necklace or bracelet. (Differently parsed as

\u201CLAN yard,\u201D it also suggests a collection of servers tied together to form a Local Area Network.)

         The lanyard should roughly do for multiplicative relationships devolving upon Zero, what the for-

mal idea of a group does for additive ones. The orbits of a unit\u2019s powers (or those of e which mime those)

likewise form closed loops of numeric thread. Lanyards should emulate these more familiar \u201Cnecklaces,\u201D

offering similar service in a different context. The lanyard needs a Zero, so that B + 0 = B for all \u201Cbeads\u201D B

belonging to it. And it needs a notion of sequencing akin to the Knight\u2019s Tour in its lack of redundancy

and completeness of circuiting. We can\u2019t say that any two beads B and C have Zero as product; but any

two beads in the lanyard must be reachable without retracings by a sequence of such links, so that adjacent

beads along the way do have Zero products. And, we want to know the necklace has a clasp: that is to say,

the lanyard is closed. That\u2019s equivalent to saying we can get from B to C in two directions without any

recrossings \u2013 that, in programmer\u2019s jargon, the beads make a doubly-linked list.

         Said formally, for all B, A belonging to a lanyard, there exist two indexable sets of lanyard beads

E and D, of m and n elements respectively, such that: 1) B x E1 = 0, Ei x Ei+1 = 0, and Em = A; 2) A x D1

= 0, Di x Di+1 = 0, and Dn x B = 0; and, 3) sets E and D have no beads in common save for those which

terminate in B and A. Finally, all Zero Divisors we know of come in pairs, so a lanyard, to be complete,

must thread both \u201Cbeads\u201D of each Assessor \u2013 and any graphical notation used to write down lanyard struc-

tures must readily distinguish switches from UNIX to DOS paths (henceforth, \u201Cu\u201D to \u201Cd\u201D \u2013 as in, also,

\u201Cup\u201D or \u201Cdown\u201D). Put the indices of beads in circles or parentheses joined by lines, and in the middle of

these lines write a sign: \u201C+\u201D if the two beads share the same internal sign, \u201C\u2013\u201D if these are different.



                                                     Page 28
\u000C         This is motivated best by show and tell. We know that Co-Assessor trios have a 6-cycle involving

changes from DOS to UNIX paths (or \u201Cdown\u201D to \u201Cup,\u201D or just \u201Cd, u\u201D for short). Obviously, the lanyard

definition was framed with things like them in mind. Using the simple graphical convention just outlined,

it is easy to see why trefoils and triple zigzags must be distinguished. Consider all the \u201Clanyard diagrams\u201D

which are possible with three links. If all three links are ( + ), we get a 3-cycle, and by the proof of Produc-

tion Rule #1, we won\u2019t get lanyards at all. If we have 2 ( + ) and 1 ( \u2013 ) (and order doesn\u2019t matter) we get

the trefoil pattern ( A + B => C \u2013 D => E \u2013 F => A \u2013 B ) which will cause both paths of each Assessor to be

included after two circuits. 1 ( + ) and 2 ( \u2013 ) would only cover half the bases ( A + B => C \u2013 D => E + F

=> A + B ) and doesn\u2019t occur with Zero Divisors (and hence as a lanyard) anyway. But all ( \u2013 ) yields the

triple zigzag ( A + B => C \u2013 D => E + F => A \u2013 B ), which does occur.

         Ultimately, a lanyard theory should explain the mysteries, already evident in this simple 3-sign

case, of which patterns make lanyards and which don\u2019t, and in which context. Such a theory might get

quite interesting (and prove quite useful) in the high-dimensioned situations looming in the future. For

now, though, lanyard description will be our modest goal. And we\u2019re about to find that there are more than

two lanyard types in a box-kite. The box-kite itself forms a 12-cycle lanyard \u2013 you can get from any zero-

dividing bead to any other without any retracings, which is not a trivial fact (consider the Traveling Sales-

man problem). And there are a handful of others, too, which we\u2019ll get to momentarily.

         The first order of business, though, is to draw the box-kites as lanyard diagrams. This is rather

easy, since all are isomorphic. The chart and graphics which follow summarize the facts which spell this

out. And it bears pointing out that each cell of the Osiris Partition maps to only one box-kite. This implies

that box-kites partition the Assessors without overlap.

         We won\u2019t prove the isomorphy of box-kites formally: it follows immediately from placing the

Assessor indices in the slots as the charting indicates, and checking against the GoTo Listings. We need,

then, just a lanyard diagram of the box-kite with abstract letters filling in the slots where actual index-pairs

should go, and a table of values to overwrite these with, in order to generate the box-kites themselves.

Also, a stripped-down Osiris Partition, showing only which box-kites get filled by which cells, is provided

as a visual aid to reflection.

              The box-kite schematic is oriented so that a triple-zigzag sail sits on top, while a triple-zigzag vent

is at the bottom. Up to triangular dihedral symmetry (left-right mirroring, plus rotations in opposite senses,

of A, B and C\u2019s lettering in tandem with F, E, D\u2019s) this serves to completely specify the structure. Com-

plete consistency of letter schemes across box-kites is achieved by rotating A, B, C into O-trip cyclic order.

Box-kites always have 3 trefoils and 1 triple zigzag among their sails (and also among their vents). In top-

down, left-right order, the 6 Assessors of each box-kite are associated with the letters A - F in the \u201CStrut

Table\u201D which follows, where actual index-pairs for each box-kite\u2019s Assessors are listed. (Strut pairs appear

in \u201Cnested parentheses\u201D order: AF, BE, CD.) For GoTo numbers, the triple-zigzag\u2019s is given first; the next

is for the trefoil extending from the topmost Assessor to the two lowermost on either side; the two sails on

the lower left, then right flanks, that join to the bottommost Assessor come last.

         As mentioned just before the \u201COsiris Partition\u201D was unveiled, the box-kites have dual structures,

called \u201CDunkin\u2019 Donuts\u201D earlier. Trademark law being what it is, it\u2019s not clear whether such a name could

be deemed grounds for legal action, so the diagram above uses an alternative that sounds just the same:

\u201CDuncan Donuts,\u201D after the great pioneer of modern dance, Isidora Duncan. Such choreography serves

quite naturally as the \u201Cdual\u201D to the \u201Cmusical round\u201D syncopations of the \u201CGoTo Listings\u201D which these

donuts supplement. One is shown above, with arrows indicating the standard \u201Cwallpaper\u201D method for

creating a torus: join top to bottom to get a tube, then join the tube\u2019s ends along the edges\u2019 arrows.

         The little cartouches with the Roman numerals show the indices of Trios\u2019 box-kites. The signs in

brackets tell which way to connect the two big bolded Octonion units with the indicated Sedenions along a

given path. Along the bottom edge, ( 3 + 14 ) zero-divides ( 2 + 15 ), and the arrow shows they can be

pasted by a Twist to the ( 2 \u2013 14 )( 3 + 15 ) at the top. All diagonals are also borders across which Twists

can be performed: ( 3 \u2013 14 )( 1 + 12 ) in Box-Kite V is transformed by Twisting into the CoAssessor Pair

( 3 \u2013 12 )( 1 \u2013 14 ) in Box-Kite VII. (Readers are encouraged to draw the other donuts for themselves.)




                                                           Page 31
\u000C          The Roman numerals used to distinguish the box-kites are not arbitrary. They correspond to the

Octonion index numbers, peculiar to each box-kite, which are called herein the strut signatures. Explain-

ing the nature of this box-kite invariant will introduce us to the second major ingredient in Zero Divisor

dynamics, after Co-Assessor trios: the paired square array of Assessor quartets, a sort of \u201CTray-Rack,\u201D

whose opposite corners are separated by the zero-division-insulating diagonals of the struts.

          As is easily checked on the box-kite diagram, the Tray-Racks associated with the 3 strut pairings

are 4-cycle lanyards. Each consecutive signing as we circuit the square is the reverse of those before and

after, tracing a pattern suggesting the hinged collapsible frames used to support snap-on tray tables. Use

the same letters with different casing, per earlier convention, for each Assessor\u2019s units, and write (b + B), (c

\u2013 C), (e + E), (d \u2013 D). This is a 4-, not 8-, cycle, since two such incomplete lanyards (another starts (b \u2013 B))

must thread the same Assessors (along mutually exclusive paths) to buttress the struts. Tours around either

of a Tray-Rack\u2019s paired frames never switch tracks without external interference (e.g., from a trefoil or zig-

zag\u2019s impetus) \u2013 which is where the dynamic interest in their seemingly stable incompleteness resides.

          Since the box-kites and their lanyard diagrams are all isomorphic, the need for deploying abstract

letter variables, so invaluable in deciphering XOR signing and triplet cycles, will be much less. Instead, the

next few paragraphs will frequently make use of one specific set of index values: those for Box-Kite III,

which had the good fortune to be the first discovered, but is otherwise in no way special. There is much to

be gained intuitively from this strategy, and (given box-kite equivalence) nothing to lose.

          Putting together the generic box-kite diagram and the specifics from the last table, the Box-Kite III

struts terminate in Assessor pairs indicated as { A, F }; { B, E }; { C, D }, which we can read off for the

kite in question this way: { ( 7, 12 ), ( 4, 15) }; { ( 5, 14 ), ( 6, 13 ) }; { ( 2, 9 ), ( 1, 10 ) }. Each of the

Assessor pairs in wavy brackets is readily shown to fail the Zero Division test. In all three instances, a

single-unit product results from multiplying, and takes on one of two index values, depending on internal

signing of the index pairs: 3, if signs are the same; 8, if different. Always, we\u2019re placed in the Zero-

Divisor-free zone of the \u201C8-Ball\u201D set, with \u20183\u2019 being the strut signature unique to Box-Kite III.

          Proof. (4 + 15)(7 + sg 12) = (6 + 13)(5 + sg 14) = (1 + 10)(2 + sg 9) = (1 \u2013 sg)8 + (1 + sg)3.

Uniqueness is verified by visual inspection of the stripped-down Osiris Partition. The Roman numeral

which names each box-kite is the only one never showing in the same-numbered row.




                                                           Page 32
\u000C         Note, too, the Roman numerals always appear in mirror-opposite pairs off the empty main diago-

nal. Each such pair in fact forms a strut, which shows the columnar layout logic of the table at the bottom:

each consecutive nesting, from the outermost (A,F) pair to the innermost (C,D) is a strut, for all box kites.

         Visualizations. Consider the PSL(2,7) representation of the Octonion multiplication via the logic

of simplicial decomposition. Let midpoints stand in for edges, and the central point for the triangle as such.

From vertex, through midpoint, to vertex, makes 3 \u201Cside triplets\u201D; cycling through midpoints makes one

\u201Cmedian-linking triplet\u201D; from vertex, through center, to midpoint, makes 3 \u201Cedge-bisector triplets.\u201D Ex-

clude the highest-dimensioned subspace (delete the central point) and the 3 edge-bisector triplets collapse,

to be replaced by the binary struts. Joining all the non-central points yields precisely the geometry of the

box-kite (with its strut signature now representing the index of the removed central unit). A stereographic

picture of the Fano plane (PSL(2,7) qua simplest finite projective geometry), showing octahedral struts and

four \u201Csails\u201D (treated as circles determined by the 3 vertices), has been published by Burkland Polster[14].

         The strut signature also plays another role. Consider the \u201Cslash-product, \u201C ( A + B)(A \u2013 B), of the

two orthogonal axes which comprise an Assessor ( A, B ). For any box-kite, all slash-products of all

Assessors have index 8 + o, where o is the strut signature. When we add to this the obvious fact that the

square of any normed Assessor axis is the negative real unit, we get this

         Lemma. All non-zero Assessor products within a box-kite are contained within the 8-Ball, and

specifically within the Quaternion copy { 1, o, 8, 8+o }, where o is the strut signature. The only things of

any interest in box-kite product structure, then, are the \u201Cstringing\u201D of the Zero\u2019s in lanyards, and the string-

ing together of Assessors\u2019 units into higher-dimensional composites . . . leading not to Zero-Dividing ortho-

gonal line-pairs like the Assessors, but to denser spaces we\u2019ll call Seinfeld hyperplanes.

         To provide a roadmap for the remainder of this section, here\u2019s the three things left to examine

before concerning ourselves with dynamics: 1) Tabulate the box-kite lanyards; 2) Collect the basic facts

about Seinfeld hyperplanes; 3) Boil down our already simplistic \u201CXOR trickery\u201D to a degree so childish as

to make higher-dimensional \u201Cbox-kite\u201D analysis easy (and give a thumbnail sketch of it for 32-D).




                                                    Page 33
\u000C         Let\u2019s tackle the last first and be done with it, for it\u2019s surprisingly straightforward. Consider Box-

Kite VII, which has a special feature: since its strut signature is the maximal 7, the sum of the indices for

each of its vertices is the maximal 15. All bits must be turned \u201Con\u201D after XORing to achieve this, so we

needn\u2019t worry about \u201Cdropped bits.\u201D Consider the convenience this offers for higher-dimensional extrapo-

lation. In particular, let\u2019s focus on the units in 32 dimensions, the \u201CPath-ions\u201D (to give them a name, after

the Cabalists\u2019 \u201C32 Paths\u201D; in 64 dimensions, we might speak of \u201CIching-ions\u201D after the Chinese system of

                                                    4
64 divinatory hexagrams). The one among the 2 \u2013 1 = 15 \u201Chyper-box-kites\u201D with maximal strut signature

                                         3
(of 15) would have, like all the others, 2 \u2013 1 = 7 struts. And since the sum of the indices at each vertex

would be the maximal 31, we can quickly jot them down, joining strut-ends with double arrows:



         ( 1, 30 ) \u00E7\u00E8 ( 14, 17 )                  ( 2, 29 ) \u00E7\u00E8 ( 13, 18 )             ( 3, 28 ) \u00E7\u00E8 ( 12, 19 )

         ( 4, 27 ) \u00E7 \u00E8 ( 11, 20 )                 ( 5, 26 ) \u00E7\u00E8 ( 10, 21 )             ( 6, 25 ) \u00E7\u00E8 ( 9, 22 )

                                                  ( 7, 24 ) \u00E7\u00E8 ( 8, 23 )



         Write some code to generate the 155 triplets by Cayley-Dickson process. Then, use the formula
                                                                                 N
presented earlier to crank out the number of triplets for lower-dimensioned 2 -ions: it works for all N.

(The existence and calculable number of triplets, G2 derivation and 8-Ball-like generation, plus the \u201Cflexi-

teed for indefinitely large N.) Drop anchor in the higher-dimensioned realm via the \u201Cmaximal strut signa-

ture trick\u201D just elucidated, and mysteries should begin revealing themselves in short order. Some \u201Ceasy

pickings\u201D: \u00BD (14)(13) = 91 paths between zero-divisors in each hyper-box-kite, minus the 7 struts, yields

84 Assessors unique to Path-ions in each. Add to these, the 42 inherited from Sedenions, and we have 126

\u2013 the number of roots in E7. The 84, meanwhile, cluster into 28 Co-Assessor Trios. (Recall the earlier re-

marks about D4 and Sedenions, and bear in mind that in the 32-D of the Pathions, the \u201Cmatter from noth-

ing\u201D magic of the Higgs mechanism finds its home in \u201CHyperdiamond Lattice\u201D thinking.)
                                                                             8
         We know that surprises will keep on coming at least up to the 2 -ions, due to the 8-cyclical struc-

ture of all Clifford Algebras. And we know at least a little about what such surprises will entail: as can



                                                        Page 34
\u000Calready be seen in low-dimensioned Clifford Algebras including non-real units which are square roots of

positive one, numbers whose squares and even higher-order powers are 0 will appear. The 8-cycle implies
                                                                                                            Nth
an iterable, hence ever-compoundable pattern, implying in its turn cranking out of numbers which are 2

roots of 0, approaching as a limit-case an analog of the \u201CArgand diagram\u201D whose infinitude of roots form a

\u201Cloop\u201D of some sort. If we can work with this it all, it could only be by having as backdrop some sort of

geometrical environment with an infinite number of symmetries . . . suggesting the \u201Cloop\u201D resides on some

sort of negative-curvature surface. For the incomparably stable soliton waves which are deployed within

such negatively curved arenas also are just about the only concrete wave-forms which meet the \u201Cinfinite

symmetries\u201D (usually interpreted as \u201Cinfinite number of conservation laws\u201D) requirement.

         Returning to our \u201Cto-do\u201D list, tabulating the remaining complete lanyards in a box-kite is easy:

there are but two. First, any five Assessors form a pyramid atop a Tray-Rack. The pyramid\u2019s apex will

have two links marked with \u2013 \u2019s leading to \u201Cbeads\u201D bounding one of the similarly marked edges of the

Tray-Rack, forming a triple zigzag; the other two \u201Cbeads\u201D of the Tray-Rack will be linked to the apex by

+\u2019s, completing three trefoils. Avoiding one of the minus-marked edges (it doesn\u2019t matter which) of the

Tray-Rack, via detours through the apex, two such \u00BE-circuits of the Tray-Rack will yield a complete 10-

cycle lanyard.

         The second complete lanyard, as adumbrated earlier, is the box-kite itself. Pick one of the Tray-

Racks, and call its plane horizontal. Move along the side marked minus which forms a trefoil with the ver-

tical strut\u2019s upper Assessor. Mark the start and end points D1 and U2. Next, move up to the apex (the path

is marked plus) and keep tracing the vertical strut\u2019s Tray-Rack edges (landing next on the node diagonally

opposite U2 in the horizontal Tray-Rack) until you reach the vertical strut\u2019s lower member: U3, D4, D5.

Return to the same Assessor (but opposite diagonal) you started with: mark it U6. Now, follow the plus-

marked edge, circuiting the horizontal Tray-Rack until you reach the far end of the first leg of the journey:

U7, D8, D9. Return to the upper Assessor of the vertical strut (D10), then trace out three edges of the third

Tray-Rack (perpendicular to the two already traced): U11, U12, and D1 completes the cycle.

         Take the two ends of the vertical strut, and join them to any edge in the horizontal Tray-Rack.

Two combinations of sail-to-vent \u201Cbutterflies\u201D are possible: both triads are trefoils, or one is a triple zig-

zag. In the first case, the behavior is the UUDD 4-cycle we\u2019ve already seen in the Tray-Rack; in the latter



                                                     Page 35
\u000Ccase, we still get a 4-cycle, but along a different path: UUUD (or DDDU). What we have, then, in all three

distinct lanyards just examined, is the predominant role of a 3 + 1 logic, itself devolving upon the 3 trefoils

per triple-zigzag linkage structure which spurred thoughts about lanyards in the first place.

         What this suggests, in turn, is the guiding hand, not of G2 , but of the Klein Group \u2013 the unsigned

signature of the Quaternions, running things by remote control from the 8-Ball. And this, finally, points to

another \u201CA-D-E\u201D-based strategy, focused on D4 , which underwrites the 4-D \u201Cclosest packing\u201D pattern of the

24 unit Quaternions \u2013 and also explains what might be called the \u201Cvirtual geometry\u201D of the trefoils and zig-

zags, whose cross-over patterns underpin box-kites. For if continuous curves are generated according to

these patterns, we get diffeomorphisms of roulette curves (one from rolling an internal, the other an ex-

ternal, circle about another) which are the respective signatures of the Elliptic and Hyperbolic Umbilics.

         These oddly named entities designate singularities in Catastrophe Theory, where A-D-E reared its

head as a \u201CProblem\u201D in the first place. The former (\u201CE.U.\u201D) traces a 3-cusped \u201Ccontrol-plane\u201D figure \u2013 a

cone based on a hypocycloid where the containing circle\u2019s radius is thrice the contained \u2013 while the latter

(\u201CH.U.\u201D) traces but one cusp, generated epicycloidally. Ditto, for the lobe counts of their hypo- and epi-

trochoidal \u201Cbehavior-plane\u201D mappings, the former just the trefoil by another name. As Arnol\u2019d was the

first to demonstrate, these two forms of type D4 are the same in 4 complex dimensions, but split into two

distinct entities in 4-D real projection.

         Abstractly, the Clifford algebra reading would relate the 3:1 trefoil-to-zigzag ratio to the \u201Cgrading\u201D
                                                                    3

\u201C+,\u2013\u201D signing of strut-end links to each other Assessor. In the Catastrophist reading, these same monomi-

als, via \u201CGroebner bases\u201D formalism and the symmetry of x,y interchangeability, are necessary and suf-

                                                                                               2       3

generally, with H.U. (\u201CD+4 \u201D) most often written x + y , and E.U. (\u201CD-4 \u201D) usually presented as x \u2013 3xy .

         These formal arguments will be given dynamic content later; for now, we still have much in the

way of naturalistic description to accomplish. First off, our inventory of complete lanyards is done, but that



                                                       Page 36
\u000Cof incomplete ones is unfinished. The full box-kite can be neatly partitioned into two halves, in two differ-

ent ways, analogous to the distinct half-complete lanyards of the Tray-Rack.

         First, looking at the lanyard diagram presented earlier, it\u2019s evident we can circuit its perimeter in

an \u201Coom-pah-pah\u201D 6-cycle \u2013 a pattern, for rhythmic reasons, we might call a \u201CWaltz Band,\u201D and wonder

about the dynamic patterns of resonance between its two (UUDUUD, DDUDDU) modes. Secondly, we

can navigate a circuit suggesting a \u201CCat\u2019s Cradle,\u201D moving only along +-signed paths. We merely go round

a Tray-Rack, avoiding minus-signed edges by going up to and down from the strut orthogonal to the Tray-

Rack, to get to the other +-signed side. (After which, we go down to and up from the lower Assessor on the

strut, returning us to our starting point.) The \u201CCat\u2019s Cradle,\u201D too, has two modes: all U\u2019s or all D\u2019s.

         And what if we attempt to do something analogous with minus-only edges? The triple-zigzags are

disjoint, so there is no way to do so. What we can do, though, is string all 6 beads in one zigzag, and then \u2013

instead of \u201Cclosing the clasp\u201D by completing the circuit \u2013 we take a +-signed journey to the other zigzag

and string all 6 of its beads. The result is a complete 12-bead strand with no clasp: closure in the sense a

group theorist would approve would require that familiar notion from spinor theory, double covering. (For

completeness\u2019 sake, I mention there is one other odd lanyard I\u2019ll call the \u201CMissing Link,\u201D which covers all

but one bead among the Assessors it visits: the reader is invited to discover it.)

         The foremost feature of interest we have yet to investigate is Assessor composition, mandated by

struts in two senses. First, precisely because Assessors at opposite ends of a strut cannot co-produce zeros,

they can each contribute one or the other diagonal\u2019s pair of imaginary units into one 4-term ensemble. But

this ensemble must zero-divide both strut-pairs of neighboring Assessors (since each zero-divides these

individually), as well as their similarly built ensembles. Must, because any pair of struts necessarily span a

Tray-Rack, each corner of which forms a Co-Assessor trio with its immediate neighbors. But it gets worse

(or better) than this: for any strut\u2019s Assessors form trios with all four other Assessors in their box-kite.

This implies the existence of hyperplanes of up to four dimensions, each point of which zero-divides each

point in another of two. The maximal, 4-D, ones will be called \u201CSeinfeld hyperplanes.\u201D

         Use the shorthand ( A, + ) to stand for an Assessor of type ( o + S ), and (F, \u2013 ) for ( o \u2013 S ).

Assume lanyard path-signing consistent with the letter scheme of the earlier box-kite diagram, and let

lower-case letters stand for real scalar values. We then get these possibilities for each box-kite.




                                                     Page 37
\u000C1.   Lines zero-dividing strut planes: It\u2019s readily checked that composites made from strut Assessors with

     the same orientation zero-divide nothing, since the signs on the lanyard diagram from each to any of

     the other four Assessors are always opposite. Take, then, as typical of oppositely oriented generators

     of a strut plane this expression: m( A, + ) + n( F, \u2013 ). All such points zero-divide ( B, \u2013 ) or ( C, \u2013 );

     or, ( D, + ) or ( E, + ). This gives 2 orientations x 3 struts x 4 Assessor choices = 24 ways.

2.   Lines zero-dividing mismatched-edge planes: For a given Tray-Rack, bounding either +-marked edge,

     take as typical the mismatch p( B, + ) + q( D, \u2013 ). All such points zero-divide either ( A, \u2013 ) or ( F, + ).

     2 orientations x 2 edges x 2 choices per orthogonal strut x 3 Tray-Racks = 24 ways. For either edge

     marked minus, take as typical the mismatch p( B, + ) + r( C, + ). All such points likewise zero-divide

     either ( A, \u2013 ) or ( F, + ), yielding the same count of 24 ways.

3.   Strut planes zero-dividing mismatched-edge planes: Take as typical m( A, + ) + n( F, \u2013 ), which zero-

     divides p( B, \u2013 ) + r( C, \u2013 ) and s( D, + ) + t( E, + ). 2 orientations x 2 choices x 3 struts = 12 ways.

4.   Strut planes zero-dividing strut planes: Take as typical m( A, + ) + n( F, \u2013 ), which zero-divides either

     p( B, \u2013 ) + t( E, + ) or r( C, \u2013 ) + s( D, + ). 2 orientations x 3 ways to pick pairs = 6 ways.

5.   Triple product of three strut planes: 2 ways by orientation, but as the path joining B to C is signed

     plus, and that joining D to E is minus, the two struts just listed as zero-dividing the first cannot zero-

     divide each other without a change in orientation: we have, then, a 6-cycle trefoil- or zigzag-like

     relation between these three planes, which indicates there is in fact but one way to obtain this result.

6.   Lines zero-dividing \u201Ctangled triad\u201D solid: Either member from the strut in Case #1 zero-divides any

     picking of 3 Assessors from the 4 choices listed there. 2 orientations x 2 strut members x 3 struts x 4

     ways to pick 3 from 4 = 48 ways.

7.   Strut planes zero-dividing \u201Ctangled triad\u201D solid: Use both strut members in the prior case instead of

     one or the other. 2 orientations x 3 struts x 4 ways to pick 3 from 4 = 24 ways.

8.   Lines zero-dividing 4-space: Only a pair of strut planes can span a 4-space, leaving two candidates for

     the line. 2 orientations x 3 ways to pick 2 struts x 2 candidates = 12 ways.




                                                       Page 38
\u000C9.   Strut plane zero-dividing 4-space: Same choices as in Case #2, except that one of the 3 strut planes is

     seen as zero-dividing the 4-space spanned by the others. 2 orientations x 3 ways to pick which strut

     plane to leave out of the 4-space = 6 ways.



     The last and ninth case subsumes all others. And as there are 7 box-kites, there are therefore 42 Sein-

feld hyperplanes \u2013 the same as the number of Assessors, to which they can be uniquely mapped, in 2 ways.

(The strut plane which zero-divides the Seinfeld hyperplane must have, as we saw in Case #1, one of its

Assessors in \u201Cup\u201D mode, and one in \u201Cdown.\u201D The strut plane being uniquely forced, identifying the Sein-

feld hyperplane with one mode or the other is tantamount to specifying the Assessor.)

     If Case #9 subsumes all others, Case #5 \u2013 the 3-strut \u201Ctriple product\u201D \u2013 is their generator. This twist-

ing of planes through a 6-cycle underwrites the whole \u201CShow About Nothing\u201D for a given box-kite. With

each step along this complete lanyard, a different Seinfeld hyperplane is effectively addressed and made

accessible. More than this, Production Rule #2 can be globalized in a special manner that allows each box-

kite\u2019s \u201Ctriple product\u201D to communicate with each other. To see this clearly, we revert to concretizing via

Box-Kite III, and consider how best to annotate these processes.

     A strut which can work in a triple product has its Assessors in opposite orientations. Write one in par-

entheses as ( o + S ), and join it with a \u2018+\u2019 to its partner, written ( o \u2013 S ). As a convention, since the strut

signature of Box-Kite III is 3, order each strut\u2019s two o\u2019s according to their cyclic order in the O-trip begin-

ning with 3, then order the three struts in ascending order of leading o\u2019s. The O-trips, recall, are ( 3, 1, 2 );

( 3, 4, 7 ); ( 3, 6, 5 ). These considerations, plus lanyard signing, lead to writing the 6-cycle this way:



         ( 1 + 10 ) + ( 2 \u2013 9 ) \u00E8 ( 4 \u2013 15 ) + ( 7 + 12 ) \u00E8 ( 6 + 13 ) + ( 5 \u2013 14 ) \u00E8

         ( 1 \u2013 10 ) + ( 2 + 9 ) \u00E8 ( 4 + 15 ) + ( 7 \u2013 12 ) \u00E8 ( 6 \u2013 13 ) + ( 5 + 14 ) \u00E8



         It\u2019s readily checked from the tables that each parenthetical term to the left of an arrow zero-divides

both such terms to the right. It\u2019s also obvious that arbitrary scalar values, of arbitrary sign, could be attach-

ed to the left of each such parenthetical dyad without affecting the zero result of any such \u201Carrow product,\u201D

thereby confirming it is planes we are dealing with. It\u2019s clear, too, that our convention for writing down




                                                      Page 39
\u000Cthe 6-cycle makes it seem to be a triple-zigzag. However, a moment of juggling terms will convince one

that other conventions of ordering terms within struts, and struts within arrows, will produce all the zeros

required, while seeming to follow the signing of a trefoil \u2013 or even, of the impossible ( +, +, + ) cycle!

         This clash of allowable conventions has other side-effects of interest: our \u201Cstrut signature cycle-

ordering\u201D protocol, for starters, also induces the left-parenthesized o terms on either side of an arrow to

have opposite orientation in their O-trip from the right-parenthesized o\u2019s. 1 x 4 \u00E8 + 5, but 2 x 7 \u00E8 \u2013 5;

for the 2nd and 5th arrows, 4 x 6 \u00E8 2, but 7 x 5 \u00E8 \u2013 2; for the 3rd and 6th , 6 x 1 \u00E8 7, but 5 x 2 \u00E8 \u2013 7.

         However, this side-effect is more general than that, in two senses. First, put the strut signature \u201C3\u201D

at the top of the standard projective PSL(2,7) triangle, and extend three rays down from it \u2013 one for each O-

trip which has a \u201C3\u201D in it \u2013 but put them in left-to-right order in any of the six possible ways, not just in the

ascending sequence of second indices per \u201Cstrut signature cycle-ordering.\u201D The same effect obtains.

         Proof. Consider the triangle as a graph of directed arrows. The \u201Ceffect\u201D can then be seen this

way: the arrows between the second indices in the 3 rays flow coherently, in the sense that the arrows form

a reversal-free loop, as if they were an O-trip. But the arrows of the third indices in the 3 rays also flow

coherently \u2013 and are, in fact, an O-trip, but with reverse clockwise sense. Thus, the segment-to-segment

mapping of the effect in question will always show arrows with reverse directions. This effect is clearly

invariant under mirror reflection along the vertical axis of the triangle (i.e., the middle O-trip ray extending

from the top). But the six possible orderings of the rays break into two sets of 3, each set of which main-

tains the directions of all arrows in the triangle, with one set the mirror image of the other.

         But the side-effect is more general in a second sense. The pair of mirror-symmetric directed

graphs just discussed are not tied to a particular strut-signature\u2019s extended rays, but emerge with similar ray

extensions made from any of the seven indices which can sit on the nodes of the graph. They are, that is, a

side-effect \u2013 a kind of signature, in fact \u2013 of the initial choice of O-trip designations and orientations from

among the 480 possible (or, more precisely, of the smaller subset which require O-trip products adhere to

the XOR rule). This follows from the fact that none of the points or lines in the triangle is distinguished

from the rest, so moving an index to a different node without altering product structure maintains the orien-

tation of all arrows. (Other indices will invariably also shift nodes, but that is irrelevant to our argument.)

Such moves are just order-7 automorphisms, by a kind of \u201Ccentral rotation\u201D acting transitively on all the




                                                      Page 40
\u000Cplane\u2019s point and line sets. (Other ways of displaying the relations of the Fano plane make this more visu-

ally obvious than does the PSL(2,7) triangle representation: see Polster, cited earlier.)

         The reason for belaboring the point? The Twist of Production Rule #2 can be applied twice (once

to each dyad) to each strut pair. But the difference in orientation just demonstrated demands the two appli-

cations be performed in correspondingly different senses. Moreover, by showing the process concretely for

Box-Kite III, we will be demonstrating it, thanks to the proven effect, for all box-kites at once. What we\u2019re

about to display and justify can be thought of as either a peculiar sort of product structure, or as an algorith-

mic procedure for taking a \u201CKnight\u2019s Tour\u201D of the zero-divisor structure of Sedenion space. As the tandem

applications of Production Rule #2, and the ways their results are recombined into strut pairs of all other

box-kites, are highly suggestive of the ways genetic material is split and remixed during fertilization, this

process is called the \u201Crecombinant divisor-navigation algorithm,\u201D or \u201Crecombinant DNA\u201D for short.

         Take two consecutive terms in the strut-product 6-cycle, writing one above the other, and accord-

ing to \u201Cstrut signature cycle-ordering\u201D protocol. Twist the dyads in each of the two columns in the same

sense \u2013 for convention\u2019s sake, let\u2019s say flip the sign of the bottom dyad\u2019s Sedenion after moving it to the

top dyad, while the sign of the top dyad\u2019s Sedenion is left unchanged after relocating. Then, collect the

resulting dyads crosswise \u2013 the left bottom dyad to the top right, the left top to the bottom right. The result

is a pair of struts (the third obtainable by Production Rule #1) for the Box-Kite whose strut signature is the

XOR of (either pair of) diagonally opposite Octonion units in the two lines being twisted.

         Now, twist the diagonally opposite dyads in the two struts, in opposite senses \u2013 for convention\u2019s

sake, let\u2019s say twist the top-left and bottom-right dyads so that the bottom dyad\u2019s Sedenion sign is flipped

after moving to the top left. But twist the bottom-left and top-right dyads so that the top dyad\u2019s Sedenion

sign is flipped after moving to the bottom left. The result is a pair of struts for the Box-Kite whose strut

signature is the XOR of (either pair of) the same-column Octonion units in the two lines being twisted.

         The three struts in a Box-Kite each have two distinct Octonion units which do not appear in the

others. Pairs of these, formed one from each strut pairing, generate two distinct XOR products. When the

\u201Crecombinant DNA\u201D procedure is performed on three consecutive pairings of struts in their 6-cycle, these

distinct XORings therefore produce the strut signatures for all 6 other Box-Kites. The group-theorist\u2019s (or

chess puzzler\u2019s) dream of a complete \u201CKnight\u2019s Tour\u201D from any strut in any box-kite to any other (and




                                                     Page 41
\u000Ctherefore from any Zero Divisor to any other) is thereby facilitated. Now let\u2019s see all this concretely,

operating on the consecutive strut-pairings of Box-Kite III.

         While looking at the schematic on the next page, contemplate the way its generality for all box-

kites was shown. As a proof, it is highly unsatisfying, relying on properties that are not very generic. The

pattern of arrow orientations seems accidental, and is not maintained by \u201Cisomorphism\u201D in Moreno\u2019s sense.

Indeed, requiring one or more O-trips to remain fixed while we \u201Crotate\u201D the other lines, all without chang-

ing multiplication rules, means we\u2019re working with the 168 symmetries of PSL(2,7). But don\u2019t these

merely serve to screen out all but 30 symmetrically equivalent unsigned labelings from the 7! = 5040 that

are possible?

         The inability to come up with a \u201Cbetter\u201D proof led to the discovery of some surprising \u201Cbad news\u201D:

equivalence of multiplication tables does not hold with Sedenions where zero-divisors are concerned. But

it also points the way toward understanding the mystery of the \u201CMoreno counterfeits\u201D with 2 mis -signed O-

trips we left hanging earlier: notions of equivalence beneath the multiplicative structure (and hence at the

level of \u201Cgraphical flow patterns\u201D) are, in fact, non-trivial. (Otherwise, the equivalent count of elements in

PSL(2,7), henceforth \u201Cthe Triangle,\u201D and the number of primitive unit zero-divisors in the Sedenions,

would be \u201Cpure coincidence\u201D \u2013 and how frequently is that the case in mathematics?)

\u000C         Before becoming too attached to the prettiness of the above algorithmic pattern \u2013 providing, as it

does, a very nice generalization to the \u201Ccomposite zero-divisor\u201D case, of the \u201CSeinfeld production\u201D mode of

interconnecting all primitive zero-divisors across box-kites -- mull the following fact. All but the simplest

\u201Clanyard theory,\u201D not to mention \u201CRecombinant DNA\u201D navigational strategies, vanish if we switch to an

arbitrary, allegedly \u201Cequivalent\u201D multiplication table by flipping signs on one or more units. The symmetry

of what lanyard diagrams we do get also breaks \u2013 and breaks in different ways for different box-kites. The

reader is encouraged to investigate the possibilities, and see what odd anomalies can be discovered: it is

not hard, for instance, to flip a few signs and get a table which generates box-kites with at least one for

which all Co-Assessor Trios are triple zigzags! (Try permuting signs on units indexed 3, 6, 5; or, try the

same with 10, 15, 12 instead. Then, using the tables provided above, look at Box Kite I in either case.)

         Abstractly, at least, this is not astonishing. It is known that the Cayley-Dickson process, for N > 3,
            N
generates 2 -ions which already suffer from a sign-flipping asymmetry of a more abstruse variety. The

iterative procedure used to create double-dimensioned extensions of the reals takes one parameter (always

+ 1 or 0) for each doubling, which parameter equals the square of a generating unit of the algebra. For N =

4, setting all 4 generators to the negative real unit creates the Sedenions we\u2019ve been focused on. For N < 4,

setting one or more generators to the positive real unit creates various modes of \u201Csplit\u201D algebras, with units

some or all of whose squares (e.g., the Pauli spin matrices) can be +1, of clear utility in relativity theory.

As with the closely allied Clifford algebras (which include the results of the Cayley-Dickson process), the

order in which differently signed parameters are fed into the underlying algorithm makes no difference . . .

unless N > 4. In that case, as Lounesto (note 4, p. 287) points out, \u201Cin contrast to the Clifford algebras,

different orderings of the parameters . . . may result in non-isomorphic algebras\u201D.

         Coming closer to the ground, let\u2019s revert to the graphics lifted from Lohmus et al. earlier, and

consider the underlying projective geometry of the Sedenion triplet structure. Each doubling of dimension

is generated by the addition of a single point. All points are defined over the field of modulo-2 integers, so

lines between points can only have coordinates whose values are 1\u2019s and 0\u2019s, meaning no line can have

more than 3 points: (1,0) and (0,1) are joined by (1,1), for instance. The extra added point can hence be

thought of as a \u201Cbit to the left,\u201D so that the generator of the Octonions from the Quaternions is represented

by a 3-bit unit (1,0,0), while the generator of the Sedenions from the Octonions is (1,0,0,0): the \u201C8-Ball.\u201D



                                                      Page 44
\u000C         By the built-in magic of projective spaces, we have dual structures: when considering projections

from N dimensions to the next dimension down, the number of points is the same as the number of (N-1)-

dimensional entities in the space, the number of lines equals the number of (N-2)-dimensioned things, and

so on. Hence, the Octonions have 7 points and 7 lines, and Sedenions have 15 points and 15 planes. With

the Octonions, there is a breakdown of algebraic symmetry manifesting in the loss of the associative pro-

perty. With the Sedenions \u2013 whose 15-D continuum can be considered as spanned by units represented by

the 15 points on the \u201Cprojective tetrahedron\u201D over the field of modulo-2 integers we saw before \u2013 there is a

breaking of geometric symmetry.       And it is manifested in the need to look beneath the usual Moreno-style

\u201Cisomorphism\u201D level, to \u201Cflow structure\u201D patterns like those utilized in the \u201Cbad proof\u201D above. So let\u2019s give

these \u201Cnot-worth-considering\u201D properties a name, and investigate their workings.

         The 168-element simple group governing the symmetries of the Triangle can be decomposed in a

natural manner into 3 quite distinct subgroups, of which it is the product. The smallest \u2013 and, for immedi-

ate purposes, most significant \u2013 of these is the 4-element \u201CKlein Group.\u201D It governs XORing among two-

bit binary strings, the rotations of a tetrahedron\u2019s altitudes into each other . . . and possible label-changes on

the Triangle when we keep an O-trip unpermuted and locked in place.

         Let\u2019s say (1 2 3 ) is on the bottom row of the Triangle, and our \u201Cidentity element\u201D labeling scheme

has 4 in the center, so that (1 7 6 ) runs up the left slope, and ( 6 5 3 ) runs down the right. Each of the 3

units in the fixed O-trip has two other O-trips running through it, and we get the other 3 elements of our

Klein group by \u201Crotating\u201D these pairs: with \u20181\u2019 as pivot, the median (1 4 5 ) is swapped with the left edge,

putting 7 in the middle, and 5 at the apex. Similarly, \u20182\u2019 as pivot interchanges the vertical and \u201Ccircular\u201D

lines\u2019 other terms, swapping 6 into the center and 4 to the apex, and making 5 and 7 exchange places. The

third rotation, with \u20183\u2019 as pivot, puts the 5 in the middle, and the left-slope midpoint, 7, at the apex.

         What we\u2019re interested in doing is freely swapping any of the 7 O-trips into the bottom row where

we\u2019ve just put ( 1 2 3 ). This implies a 7-element cyclic group, which in turn requires the triangular dihed-

ral group be included, to allow for rotating the Triangle and/or reflecting through median lines \u2013 which,

combined with the Klein Group, has the side-effect of allowing any permutation of the \u201Cfixed\u201D O-trip to

replace it in the \u201Cfixed\u201D position. Now let\u2019s see why we\u2019re interested in this.

\u000C         The labeling operation on the leftmost Identity Triangle which appears on the far right \u2013 the pro-

duct, in turn, of the two in the middle \u2013 is the scheme of arrows implicit in the \u201Cbad proof\u201D conducted

above. Consider the \u201CIdentity\u201D scheme, flush left: take any of the 7 O-trips, and arrange the Triangle\u2019s

labels so that the chosen O-trip sits on the bottom, with the arrows of the others arrayed as shown. We say

the new arrangement is \u201Cflowmorphic\u201D to it. By using PSL(2,7)\u2019s group operations, we can \u201Crotate\u201D any O-

trip into the bottom-most position, so that 7 such \u201Cflowmorphs\u201D can be produced. That\u2019s just for Octonion

labelings: but recall our earlier observations concerning the \u201C8-Ball,\u201D and you\u2019ll see that all labelings of

the Triangle with an O-trip at bottom and \u20188\u2019 in the middle are \u201Cflowmorphic\u201D to our \u201CIdentity\u201D scheme.

         For any S-trip ( o, 8, 8+o ) will have all arrows from any of the 3 o\u2019s through the \u20188\u2019 pointing to-

ward the pure Sedenion. The extra bit in the \u20188\u2019 has, meanwhile, no effect on the orientation of the remain-

ing 3 lines, since XORing will remove it between S\u2019s, and preserve it between an o and an S. The 7 O-trips

thereby generate 7 8-Ball-containing O-copies, all \u201Cflowmorphs\u201D of the Octonions proper.

         When the mystery arose, we didn\u2019t yet know that all \u201CO-copies\u201D containing the 8-Ball could not

harbor zero-divisors. So we see that \u201Cflowmorphs\u201D are not merely isomorphic in Moreno\u2019s sense, but also

include precisely and only those \u201CMoreno isomorphs\u201D which do not harbor zero-divisors. How to get the

converse \u2013 that copies of the Triangle which do harbor zero-divisors are not flowmorphic to the Octonions

proper or the septet of 8-Ball-holding Triangles in the PGL(4,2) Tetrahedron?

         Let\u2019s bring to mind a built-in asymmetry of the Octonion flow-system we\u2019re focused on: if we

circuit the Triangle labeled like our 8 flowmorphs, orientation along edges is not invariant, but reverses

either once or twice, depending upon the clockwise sense of one\u2019s circuiting. The Sedenion tetrahedron,

however, has rotational symmetry, which will conflict with the flow-system asymmetry of our 8 flow-

morphs, yielding the \u201C2 signing conflicts\u201D we cited as a computable fact (and unresolved mystery) earlier.




                                                    Page 46
\u000C         Proof. Consider the Octonions\u2019 Triangle to be the base of the tetrahedron, then consider the face

containing the (1 2 3) O-trip. But for this bottom-edge-spanning O-trip, all flow-lines on the face are S-

trips included in an 8-Ball-containing O-copy. The 3 flowmorphs incorporating the O-trips joining edge

midpoints to vertices in the base obviously include the 8-Ball in the center and the 12 at the top, so this

covers the face\u2019s 3 lines proceeding down from the apex to the 1, 2 and 3. Similarly, the two diagonal

flow-lines belong to the 2 flowmorphs incorporating the O-trips spanning the base\u2019s other two edges. Fi-

nally, the midpoint-cycle is derived from rotating the base\u2019s midpoint circle (2 5 7) onto an edge, putting

the 8-ball in the middle, and getting the face\u2019s midpoint-cycle as a same-way-oriented edge.

          Rotate the tetrahedron in the same sense as the (2 5 7) midpoint circle\u2019s arrow. This will cause

the midpoint circles in the 3 faces to mirror the orientation of the base\u2019s ( 2 5 7 ). But it will also induce a

cycling through the 3 flowmorphs straddling midpoint-to-vertex joins in the base. The flow-asymmetry of

the base, however, will cause one of the 3 flow-lines shared with the face (the rightmost edge, which points

down in flowmorphs) to reverse orientation, as the opposite, up-oriented, edge of the flowmorph is rotated

through it. Meanwhile, the same sequence of rotations will cause the 3 flowmorphs set on the base\u2019s edges

and with apices in face-edge midpoints to be cycled through, with the same result on the median descend-

ing to the \u20183\u2019 at bottom-right. And, since the midpoint-cycle is unaffected by the rotations, we get only 2

flow-lines with reversed orientation in the face. Lastly, we saw before that no flipping of signs on units can

bring the face into correspondence (and hence make it flowmorphic) with the Octonions\u2019 Triangle. By

symmetry, the same result obtains for all 3 faces attaching to the base, and (via rotations of the other lines

of the base to its edges) to the remaining 4 8-Ball-free triangles. Q.E.D.

          We can now see, too, that getting the same 2 lines to be mis -signed, no matter what inputs were

fed into Moreno\u2019s mapping machine, is a red herring: ( 3 4 7 ) and ( 3 6 5 ) are just the median and edge

which get reversed when ( 1 2 3 ) is the fixed O-trip in the \u201Cflowmorphic\u201D labeling, and the Tetrahedron is

rotated per above . . . and recall that Moreno\u2019s mapping specified the association of this O-trip with its first

three outputs!

                                      *        *         *         *         *

\u000C         It would be easy to dwell on the last few pages\u2019 analysis and assume a negative attitude. Yet not

many years ago, data later touted as evidence of Chaos Theory\u2019s ubiquity was regularly tossed out by

experimentalists as proof a test had gone awry and needed redoing. In other arenas, finding \u2013 as we\u2019ve just

done by spinning the projective tetrahedron \u2013 that internal symmetries are injected into the behaviors you

thought them insulated from, would be cause for celebration. The theory of \u201Ccomposed maps\u201D in the early

history of Catastrophe Theory, for instance, was built upon just such sought-for phenomena, which were

sought precisely because their mathematics gave promise of mimicking the fundamental life processes of

morphogenesis, where the \u201Cinternal symmetries,\u201D of course, are harbored in the DNA.

         In the early days of quantum theory, Niels Bohr\u2019s \u201CLight and Life\u201D and Erwin Schrodinger\u2019s

\u201CWhat Is Life?\u201D inspired a generation of physicists to migrate to molecular biology. In our own day, some

two generations after Watson and Crick, the new theory of quantum computation is leading to a rethinking

about the bases of life processes that promises to inspire a second great migration. A paper delivered in the

first fortnight of the new Millennium, and not yet in print (but downloadable from the Internet) as I write

this, can be taken as a harbinger of such a shift. In \u201CQuantum Algorithms and the Genetic Code\u201D[15],

Apoorva Patel identifies components of DNA structure which implement Grover\u2019s algorithm of quantum

search, proposing a key role for enzymes in maintaining the quantum coherence of the process. The view

of DNA replication and protein synthesis he conjures culminates in a spectacular explanation for \u201Cwhy

living organisms have 4 nucleotide bases and 20 amino acids\u201D: he writes, \u201CIt is amazing that these numbers

arise as solutions to an optimization problem\u201D \u2013 especially an optimization of a quantum algorithm!

         What results like these and, more critically, the mind-sets which can generate them, should sug-

gest to us is this: the usual assessment of \u201Cnegative results\u201D in studying hypercomplex numbers may

require some standing on its head. Recast the problem as related to the workings of life itself, and things

look somewhat different. Think of high-energy physics as cast in the image of life processes instead of the

other way, and things seem more different still.

         Imagine the Cayley-Dickson process as analogous to mitosis, with Sedenions representing some-

thing akin to the fourth bifurcation of a fertilized egg. The collapse of the equivalence of multiplication

tables then appears as an eminently sensible defensive strategy, put in place to protect the budding embryo

from external invaders: it takes on the trappings, that is, of an immune system response.

\u000C         Without the \u201Copen sesame\u201D of the right \u201Ckeycode,\u201D isolating the lettering scheme in actual use

becomes a needle-in-haystack quest. With the code, though, navigability via \u201Crecombinant DNA\u201D tactics,

or the earlier-discussed combination of box-kite dynamics and Twist products, allows for \u201Cmaking some-

thing out of nothing\u201D in ways we\u2019ve yet to fathom. What we have described herein is not likely to mark the

end of the utility of \u201Cdimension doubling\u201D in number theory; quite probably, it merely points the way past

slow beginnings.



{ IV }   Heuristic Afterthoughts on Dynamic Possibilities:

         From the viewpoint of specialists, the realms of Lie-algebraic gauge theory and stably unfolded

singularities would seem totally unrelated. Naively, however, the study of zero-divisors (arising most

\u201Cnaturally\u201D in the space of Sedenions, where the Dirac Equation lives) cannot be too far removed from the

study of the \u201Czeros\u201D of ensembles of polynomials. Philosophically, too, the only author to write major texts

on both the Lie and Catastrophe theories, Robert Gilmore, finds it necessary to insert a singularity substrate

beneath the smooth surface of symmetries that obsesses contemporary physicists:

         There is nothing spontaneous about symmetry breaking. It is a consequence of some
         dynamics or some variational principle. The word \u201Cspontaneous\u201D is a smokescreen
         behind which hides a vast ignorance of the nonlinear mathematics which ultimately
         provides a description for the physical processes at hand. It is this nonlinear mathematics
         which is of central importance. The presence of symmetries allows higher catastrophes
         to occur at the cost of fewer control parameters. Many different symmetries may play the
         same restrictive role for a given nonlinear dynamics. The nonlinear mathematics is
         central, symmetry peripheral. Symmetry exists to be broken. To regard \u201Cspontaneous
         symmetry breaking\u201D as the driving force behind some physical process is to miss entirely
         that physical process. ( Reference 6, p. 462 )

         A triptych of figures sits immediately above the quoted passage in Gilmore\u2019s text, illustrating a

sequence of phase transitions physicists often call the \u201CMexican hat\u201D: a parabolic bowl is poised mouth up

at time zero; in the second snapshot, its bottom begins to flatten out against some plane of resistance; in the

final panel, the central region where flattening has concentrated dimples up, yielding the overall contour of

a sombrero. (Put metastable \u201Cfalse vacuum\u201D atop its crown, \u201Ctrue vacuum\u201D in the brim-rimmed trough.)

         To the Catastrophist, this same set of figures signifies something apparently quite different from

Higgs mechanisms governing mass\u2019s emergence from the Void. The initial picture implies a two-dimen-

                     2    2
sional potential V = x + y , and its squashing suggests a destabilizing perturbation, the smooth unfolding




                                                   Page 49
\u000Cof whose effects requires a \u201Cfigure of regulation\u201D organizing the action of nonlinear \u201Ccontrols\u201D on the two

\u201Cbehaviors\u201D x and y. By a fairly exact analogy to the linear situation, where force is proportional to accel-

eration, the \u201Cfrictional\u201D effects of higher-order terms start at two derivatives\u2019 distance from the potential in

question. \u201CSiersma\u2019s Trick\u201D provides a remarkably simple picture: monomials making up a regulatory

ensemble or \u201Cgerm\u201D are pinpointed on Pascal\u2019s Triangle, with those in their \u201Cshadow\u201D at two or more deri-

vatives\u2019 remove comprising the \u201Charmonics\u201D being damped or amplified by \u201Ccontrols.\u201D For the case at

                                                                              4      4
hand, the \u201Cgerm terms\u201D at two steps from the \u201Cbehavior\u201D at the onset are x and y ; the (nine) controls,

                                                                                              2       2
then, reside in the 3 x 3 rhombus whose corners are the real unit at the apex (\u201Cline zero\u201D), x and y at the

                           2 2
ends of line two, and the x y pendant at the center of the fourth line, of the Triangle.

         From the topologist\u2019s vantage, one of these controls is trivial (the real unit), and one is quite spe-

cial (the fourth-order term). Usually called, instead, a \u201Cparameter,\u201D this nonlinear term is special because

of the peculiar invariance it underwrites. If four lines are allowed to intersect each other in an arbitrary

manner (are put in \u201Cgeneral position\u201D) in the x,y plane, the most general algebraic representation of their

situation involves the product of four terms of type ax + by, while their most general geometric characteri-

zation would pinpoint the projective invariance of the \u201Ccross-ratio\u201D determined by four such lines. (That

is, the smooth navigation between all possible \u201Cpoints of view\u201D on a scene \u2013 most concretely realized in

aerial reconnaissance photography, where readily fixed signposts like railroad tracks serve to anchor the

measurements \u2013 depends upon the unchanging pattern of proportionality between any four points \u2013 or, by

projective-geometric \u201Cduality,\u201D four lines \u2013 being viewed from various perspectives.)

         What makes this \u201Cspecial\u201D is the context in which it first emerged into view: half a century ago,

Milnor and Kervair found, in 8-D and up, that manifolds could be homeomorphic yet not diffeomorphic

(i.e., transformable into each other by \u201Crubber sheet geometry,\u201D but at the cost of loss of \u201Csmooth transi-

tions\u201D in their dynamic descriptions). This seemed baffling at the time, but has since become almost tame:

viewed in other contexts, kindred phenomena are readily grasped \u2013 may even, in fact, seem \u201Cobvious.\u201D

         At the beginnings of perspective geometry itself, for instance, the great mystic, church leader, and

mathematical visionary, Nicholas of Cusa, exploited the illusory effect of the newfangled \u201Ctrompe d\u2019oeil\u201D

painting in an inspirational discourse offered to the inhabitants of a monastery. The eyes of the painting, he

said, like the \u201CVision of God\u201D (his lecture\u2019s title), seem to follow you, no matter where you stand in relation


                                                     Page 50
\u000Cto them. If you let your ego delude you, you may come to think that God has singled you out and succumb

to spiritual inflation; if you transcend this snare, however, you will get a glimpse of the higher truth that all

may singly feel His gaze upon them in just the same manner, hence implying the omnivoyance of the

Creator. (This illusion is now so well-known as to be a clich\u00E9, and is entertainingly discussed, bereft of all

metaphysics, in a page of Steinhaus\u2019 delightful classic, \u201CMathematical Snapshots\u201D; but in Cusa\u2019s day, its

effect was a novelty \u2013 and a mystery \u2013 of a very high degree.)

         In modern parlance, students of Chaos, Artificial Life, and systems far from equilibrium speak not

of God\u2019s Omnivoyance, but of Order\u2019s \u201Cself-emergence\u201D: consider, for instance, the multitude of indivi-

dual cellular beings who can combine to form the fruiting body of that singular entity we call a slime mold

(an example favored by both systems theorist Ilya Prigogine[16] and catastrophist E. C. Zeeman[17]).

And, instead of the \u201Ctrompe d\u2019oeil\u201D painting, we could just hand somebody a three-mirror prismatic kalei-

doscope. Unlike the ubiquitous, hexagonally-symmetric, two-mirror scopes every child knows, the three-

mirror prismatic kind display an infinite number of centers of symmetry, not just one. Likewise, the

Double Cusp Catastrophe (the two-potential kindred of the \u201Csombrero\u201D surface introduced above) can be

viewed as having an infinite number of germinal centers \u2013 one for each distinct value of its \u201Cparameter.\u201D

         In certain applications, this parameter can be treated as delimiting, for a small range of values at

either side of its zero, a \u201Csweet spot\u201D within whose confines certain optimal transformations are possible

which are otherwise unavailable. For \u201Calmost all\u201D parameter values, \u201Csweet\u201D or not, oscillations and trans-

formations between a very small number of stable regimes are possible (no more than five, in fact). But for

the two critical values of the \u201Cparameter\u201D which bound the \u201Csweet spot,\u201D control breaks down utterly, and

chaos (in the guise of an infinite-dimensional \u201Ccontrol space\u201D) can ensue. This can, in fact, happen in the

\u201Creal world\u201D: square sea-going vessels built with vertical sides all the way round, like floating oil-rig

platforms which haven\u2019t yet been moored to the ocean\u2019s bottom, can be rendered violently unstable by

small perturbations of wind and wave[18].

                    4   4    2 2
         When x + y + Kx y has parameter K = +2, this ensemble can be factored into the \u201Csquared

         2    2 2
circle\u201D (x + y ) . Then, instead of the figure of regulation displaying a simple polygonal symmetry (most

commonly, the fourfold variety inspiring this unfolding\u2019s \u201CDouble Cusp\u201D name), we get the limit of n-gonal

symmetry as n tends toward infinity: the circular troughing, that is, of the \u201CMexican hat\u201D dynamics. When,



                                                     Page 51
\u000Cfurther, this general mode of unfolding is subjected to various constraints (most notably, the bilateral sym-

metry which controls the morphogenesis of most complex living things), the parameter can optimally take

values outside the \u201Csweet spot\u201D \u2013 thereby guaranteeing a \u201CMexican hat\u201D phase transition if the constraints

are somehow suddenly relaxed, leading the untrammeled dynamic to then home in on the \u201Csweet spot.\u201D

         The possibilities just alluded to in the last paragraph can be extremely subtle, and are still not

completely understood by singularity theorists. What the theorists do have a thorough grasp of, however,

are the taxonomical categories: all the types of \u201Cparameter\u201D-containing singularities (although not their

detailed behaviors) have been determined up to very high dimension. And, not surprisingly, the method of

their determination is a straightforward extension of the \u201CA-D-E\u201D logic whose cross-disciplinary ubiquity

first emerged in the classificatory study of the parameter-free, \u201Celementary\u201D catastrophes.

         Let\u2019s take the simple-minded view: for \u201Cparameter-free\u201D catastrophes, the catalog embraces ana-

logs of n-sided polygons (short-hand: A n ), their flippable siblings (the D series, \u201CD\u201D for \u201Cdihedral), and a

finite set of three exceptional 3-D templates, the so-called Platonic solids (the E series, \u201CE\u201D for \u201Cexception-

al\u201D or \u201CEuclidean,\u201D depending on taste). Meanwhile, thanks to the magic of the \u201CA-D-E Problem,\u201D the

three major division algebras can be correlated with one instance of each letter: A 2 for Imaginaries, D4 for

Quaternions, E8 for Octonions. The collapse of division algebras is thereby correlated with the emergence

of \u201Cparameters\u201D and non-elementary catastrophes. Might not their \u201Cextended Dynkin diagram\u201D logic,

therefore, provide highly qualified candidates for ferreting out the secrets of zero-divisor arithmetics?

         In the heart of Plato\u2019s Timaeus, a mathematical creation myth would spawn the building blocks of

matter from the \u201Cideal\u201D polyhedra, but would generate these, in their turn, from three mysterious triangles.

It is these which are the templates for the non-elementary catastrophes, as well \u2013 and, by \u201Cextended A-D-E\u201D

logic, for the three varieties of three-mirror prismatic kaleidoscopes also. Each \u201CTimaeus triangle\u201D pro-

vides the template for an infinite series of higher-order forms[19]. They can be \u201Cread off\u201D as follows.

         The singularity theorist, as if he were taking the famed analogy of \u201CPlato\u2019s Cave\u201D literally,

determines the fundamental characteristics of his quarry in the Imaginary realm, and then projects down

from complex space to our \u201Cshadow\u201D realm of \u201Creal\u201D solutions. As the great experimentalist, Sir David

Brewster, knew soon after inventing the kaleidoscope, easy geometric arguments give only three kinds of

three-mirror prismatics (and one with four mirrors which, for reasons that will be implicit in what follows,


                                                     Page 52
\u000Care of little interest to singularity theorists, since all the mirrors are at right angles)[20]. And, as his con-

temporaries were the first to fathom, angles are naturally interpreted as exponents in the complex plane.

            The Timaeus Triangles, then, are readily grasped as involving three behavior variables, the com-

ponent of the germ specific to each being raised to the power of the aliquot part of the semicircle indicated

when putting the mirrors in place to make the prism. The equilateral triangle then leads to writing a \u201Cgerm
        3      3     3
term\u201D X + Y + Z , which (by the extension of \u201CSiersma\u2019s Trick\u201D to Pascal\u2019s Tetrahedron) has six controls

(operating on X, Y, Z, and XY, YZ, and ZX) and one parameter (the XYZ monomial). The isosceles right

                                                   4    4     2                                         2
triangle (the Double Cusp) is written thus: X + Y + Z (effectively two behaviors, as the Z part of the

term can have only linear \u2013 and hence, trivial \u2013 unfolding). Finally, the 30-60-90 triangle is written as just
 6     3      2                                                                     2 2
X + Y + Z , with parameter of the same form as with the Double Cusp: X Y .

            These three are respectively shorthanded as P8 , X9 , and R10 , with two less than the index indicat-

ing the number of controls. When treated as the instantiating \u201Cstarter kit\u201D for making an infinite number of

higher-order forms, they are shorthanded T3,3,3 , T2,4,4 and T2,3,6 in that order. We might consider the \u201CT\u201D

to stand for \u201Ctoroidal,\u201D since the polycentric nature of these singularities\u2019 unfoldings \u2013 like the invariant

symmetric figure used to \u201Cwallpaper\u201D the layout of their kaleidoscopes\u2019 ever-changing visuals \u2013 is obvious-

ly generated by a torus-map built using the appropriate Timaeus Triangle as template. (Brewster didn\u2019t use

such terminology, far less that of elliptic function theory, but his pictures and geometric preliminaries con-

vey this message quite readily to the mathematically attuned modern reader.)

            Now the question of moment is how all this relates to the theory of zero-divisors in Sedenion

space; the harbinger of the answer can be found in the study of \u201Calcoves\u201D which emerges in Tits\u2019 theory of

buildings. Here, not the root structure proper, but the Weyl groups of its associated system of affine reflec-

tions, are germane. In a classic text on Coxeter theory, James E. Humphreys introduces alcoves with a

telling example: if the affine Weyl group has rank 2, the associated alcoves \u201Care triangles with angles \u03C0 / k,

\u03C0 / l, \u03C0 / m, where (k,l,m) = (3,3,3), (2,4,4), (2,3,6), in the respective cases A 2 , B2 , G2 .\u201D[21] In other words,

when moving from standard root-structure interpretation to the associated infinite-dimensional affine

system, an exact correspondence is found between the simplest \u201Cnon-elementary\u201D catastrophes and the

simplest non-trivial Coxeter-Dynkin diagrams \u2013 including Guillermo Moreno\u2019s favorite G2 !

this manner, the geometry of the germ bears a close affinity to the context of Co-Assessor Trios\u2019 toroidal

\u201Cping-pong dynamics\u201D briefly touched upon much earlier. For now, we take some smaller steps toward a

zero-divisor interpretation of Double Cusp dynamics. The reader is referred back to the graphic of the

\u201CDuncan donut\u201D torus map, as the \u201Caccident\u201D of its correspondence to the standard \u201Cextended Dynkin

diagram\u201D for the Double Cusp (four isosceles right triangles making a box) will be our starting point.

         How could a torus map like this relate to forms of number? Considering how will take us back to

the simpler (or at least, non-Sedenion) context of the 8-D Clifford algebra usually shorthanded Cl(3), and

containing the Quaternions, three \u201CCounter-Quaternion\u201D units which are non-real square roots of positive

unity (\u201Cdouble numbers\u201D in the literature[22]), and an imaginary unit which commutes with all the above.

         Introduced algebraically by W. K. Clifford, the Italian geometer Corrado Segr\u00E9 was the first to

study the geometry of the number forms required by such a \u201Cdouble\u201D unit. He showed its continuum of

powers entails a 4-space with 1 real and 2 imaginary axes, plus one for the \u201Cdouble\u201D unit itself; and, that

this latter\u2019s orbit consists of two orthogonal circles centered on (mutually zero-dividing) idempotent points,

passing respectively through the \u201Cdouble-unit\u201D axis at \u00B11, and meeting in the real unit. Implicit is a kind of

exponentiation defined on all points of the 2-torus \u201Cdoughnut,\u201D so that its 4-space (like that of Penrose\u2019s

twistor construct) is isomorphic to the product space of two standard complex circles[23].

         Segr\u00E9\u2019s work was long gathering dust when Charles Mus\u00E8s[24] independently arrived at a more

modern-looking formulation, which explicitly referenced Pauli spin matrices and the operator language of

the quantum-mechanical toolkit, all recast into so-called \u201Chypernumber\u201D forms. Mus\u00E8s also created an

extrapolation of Octonions to 16-D, including spin-matrix analogs of the 7 imaginary units, plus the com-

mutative imaginary now familiar in Clifford-algebra texts, but quite unusual in the physics literature of the

late 60\u2019s to early 80\u2019s, when Mus\u00E8s wrote the bulk of his papers. This 16-D \u201CM-algebra\u201D has the basic

structure of the superstring theorists\u2019 E8 x E8 , and so was quite prophetic of things to come a decade later.

Ironically, though, the advent of theoretical approaches portended by his own led to Mus\u00E8s\u2019 own work

falling by the wayside in mainstream research. (But Tony Smith\u2019s website has recently resurrected this rich

vein of pioneering work, which the reader is encouraged to explore.)



                                                    Page 55
\u000C                                                                                                          4       4   2
         We consider, first, the basic 4-D spin-matrix geometry. It conforms to the X + Y + Z form of

the Double Cusp\u2019s \u201CTimaeus Triangle,\u201D as it: (1) is spanned by two imaginary units (period 4) and one

spin unit (period 2); and, (2) has all orbits on a 2-torus. But the connection cuts deeper still. Before we can

elicit it, however, we\u2019ll need a quick boil-down of Mus\u00E8s\u2019 notation and most basic results.

         Using the Greek lower-case epsilon (e) for his spin units, and the usual i for imaginaries, he uses

the subscript 0 to signify respectively the real unit and the \u201Ccommutative i,\u201D while the subscripts 1 \u2013 3

signify the standard Quaternion 2x2 matrices, and spin units which are equal to the same-indexed Quarter-

nion with each of its matrix entries multiplied by the negative of the usual imaginary unit. This gives

                  ek \u00B7 ik = ik \u00B7 ek = i0,          ek \u00B7 i0 = i0 \u00B7 ek = ik,              ik \u00B7 i0 = i0 \u00B7 ik = (\u2013 ek )

         For ik , ek , 4 < k < 7, 2x2 matrix representations are not possible, since Octonions are in general not

associative; however, by constructing so-called \u201Cbi-matrices\u201D Mus\u00E8s extends his e-numbers to provide a

full \u201Ccounter-complex\u201D complement to the Octonions in his 16-D \u201CM-Algebra.\u201D The indexing rules are

identical to those for Octonions, so that i0 commutes among same-indexed units in this context also. Hence,

by the usual \u201Cassociative triplets\u201D rule combined with Mus\u00E8s\u2019 felicitous XORing of indices,

                  em \u00B7 in = im \u00B7 en = e[m xor n]   and          em \u00B7 en = (\u2013 i[m xor n] )

         Mus\u00E8s\u2019 manner of writing his \u201Chypernumber\u201D version of de Moivre\u2019s Theorem is rather cumber-

some \u2013 in fact, he must write two separate equations, one for each circle attaching to \u00B1e. A much cleaner

and more elegant \u201CSpin Control Equation\u201D can be derived, relating the product of the circles to their sum:

                              (\u2013 e )K \u00B7 (+ e )Q = (\u2013 e )K + (+ e )Q \u2013 1

         If we set K (Q) constant, while letting Q (K) vary freely, each choice of the constant exponent

yields a circle, isometric and parallel to the spin orbit denoted by the varying exponent. Most obviously, if

the constant exponent be set to 0, we get one or the other spin-orbit circle; if the constant be set to \u00B11, we

get circles parallel to the spin-orbit circles, but centered on the negative of the appropriate idempotent. For

some index m, if K and Q for (\u00B1 em ) are equal in magnitude and similarly (oppositely) signed, we get i0 2K

( im2K ) \u2013 showing, again, the 4-cycle nature of the imaginaries to the spin-unit\u2019s 2-cycle. Numerous other

variations can be obtained by setting the exponents to be imaginary or spin-unit quantities, etc.

\u000C         Returning now to the Double Cusp, it, like all the Catastrophes, is a stratified object: it is built up

entirely and only of simpler singularities, in the manner of a programmer\u2019s \u201Cobject hierarchy.\u201D But as its

structure is dualistic, entailing a framework for resolving conflicts between two fields of behaviors, its

strata can be prepared from more than one point of view. And by containing a parameter (also called a

\u201Cmodulus,\u201D so that this germ is often dubbed of \u201Cunimodular\u201D type in the literature), we can be assured its

stratification has other subtleties as well. The key vantages are three:

         I: \u201CPlatonic sequence\u201D -- Viewed collectively with P8 and R10 as support for the infinite T-

series, X9 is not only built upon a \u201CTimaeus triangle,\u201D but contains a maximal two-behavior stratum which

is associated with one of the Platonic polyhedra. P8 contains E6 (hence, \u201Ctetrahedrality\u201D); X9 contains E7

(and thereby the symmetry common to cube and octahedron); R10 houses E8 (the dodeca- and icosa- hedral

duals). Earlier, while briefly touching on the coming attractions of what we can find in the 32-D \u201CPath-

ions,\u201D it was noted that the sum total of \u201CAssessor\u201D-like entities in each \u201Chyper-box-kite\u201D was 126 \u2013 the

number of roots in E7 . The suggestion is that this \u201CPlatonic\u201D view of Double Cusp stratification, while

pointing to lower-dimensional forms in the Catastrophe context, points to higher (32-D) forms in Zero-

Divisor theory. Knowing nearly nothing about the latter, exploring this possibility must be deferred.

         II: \u201CUmbilic sequence\u201D -- In discussing lanyards, the germs of the elliptic and hyperbolic umbi-

lics (\u201CEU\u201D and \u201CHU\u201D) were related to the monomials of the line of Pascal\u2019s Triangle that generated Cl(3),

with their attendant geometries being related, in their turn, to the trefoil/zigzag dichotomy. In a classic

study of \u201CThe Umbilic Bracelet,\u201D E. C. Zeeman[25] showed how a 3-cusped hypo- (or 1-cusped epi- )

cycloidal section could be used as the base of a cylinder which, with a 1/3 \u201Ctwist,\u201D could have its two ends

joined together in a torus, with this \u201Cbracelet\u201D providing a basis for the Double Cusp\u2019s stratification. If the

hypocycloid is used, all points inside the bracelet are EU\u2019s and all outside are HU\u2019s, and vice-versa for the

epicycloid. The \u201Cskin,\u201D in either case, is made up of \u201Cparabolic umbilic\u201D points, whose germs unfold with

one more control than EU or HU, and contain them both as strata, in precisely the manner a tilting flash-

light intersects a wall in a parabola for one infinitesimal angle between its sweeping out of ellipses and

hyperbolae. The closed loop traced by the cusp edges, meanwhile, supports the higher \u201CE6\u201D stratum.

\u000CThe umbilic bracelet\u2019s dual representations are shown at left. The HU\u2019s 1-cusped epi-, and the EU\u2019s 3-
cusped hypo-, cycloid sections are shown below. (From pp. 62-3, Poston & Stewart, Taylor Expansions
and Catastrophes, Pitman, London, 1976: \u201Csymbolic\u201D stratum = E6 )




And from p. 105 of same source, \u201CSiersma\u2019s Trick\u201D for Double Cusp.




The K:Q = 2:1, 3:1, and 3:2 \u201Cpower orbits\u201D of the Spin Control Equation, displayed \u201Csix-pack\u201D style, in
unit-per-half-edge, zero-centered boxes, as described in the text on the following pages.




                                                   Page 58
\u000C         In a pair of preprints, Zeeman\u2019s associates Ian Stewart and Tim Poston built a \u201Cquartic bracelet\u201D

which tweaked out higher-order stratificational organization, devolving upon the hypocycloid of 4 cusps, or

\u201Castroid,\u201D and exploiting the cross-ratio module as basis for foliation[26]. Meanwhile, the Double Cusp\u2019s

naming assumed that four minima defined the full unfolding, but James Callahan[27] demonstrated the

existence of a yet higher-order stratification, allowing for 5 minima (but not necessarily a 5-cusp bracelet).

This is as far as one can go, since 5 minima require separation by 4 maxima or saddles, and no unfolding of

\u201CX9\u201D can have more than 9 critical points (which is where the form\u2019s index number derives).

         This sequence emerges unbidden from the Spin Control Equation. If the two circles\u2019 exponents

are in fixed rational ratio, the three simplest such proportions among relatively prime integers are 2:1, 3:1,

and 3:2. (Since 1:0 or 0:1 gives us one or the other spin-unit circle, and 1:1 yields the imaginary orbits, we

discount these as \u201Ctrivial.\u201D We also don\u2019t care about relative signing or positioning of the exponents K and

Q, as it makes no difference to our main point, and so assume both are similarly signed, and the leftmost is

the larger, in what follows.) Each generates closed helical windings about the torus for its orbit; and, if we

take the 4-D equivalent of an architect\u2019s plan, we get 6 planar sections, one per each pair of axes.

         As a quick bit of boilerplate building with a software package like Mathcad readily shows, these 6

sections can always be arrayed in 3 pairs, such that each pair contains all 4 axes. The pair containing the

(1, in ) and ( i0 , en ) planes will show isomorphic, identically sized, rose curves, containing K + Q \u201Cpetals,\u201D

each housing one stable regime or \u201Cminimum\u201D \u2013 precisely what the hypocycloids in the \u201Ccontrol\u201D space

map into in \u201Cbehavior\u201D space. (In classical parlance dating back to Maclaurin and the first days of the

calculus, the latter is generated from the former as its \u201Cpedal curve\u201D with respect to its center.)

         The pair containing the (1, i0 ) and ( in , en ) planes will show isomorphic, identically sized, epitro-

choids. These are curves of the broad family which Albrecht Durer first explored in the 1520\u2019s, generated

by a point attached to the (possibly extended) diameter of a small circle rolling around the circumference of

a larger, and corresponding, in the 2:1 case, to the map in \u201Cbehavior\u201D space of the HU\u2019s epicycloid (with

the rose-to-epitrochoid pairing obtaining for the higher strata.) The remaining planes, the intersections of

whose main diagonals with circles of radius (\u00BD)\u00BD correspond to the idempotents and their negatives --

\u00BD(\u00B11 \u00B1 en ) -- and their square roots \u00BD(\u00B1 i0 \u00B1 in ) respectively, contain Lissajous figures associated with the

ratios between the spin-unit circles\u2019 angular velocities.




                                                      Page 59
\u000C         We know that the 2-torus in 4-D is diffeomorphic to the 3-D doughnut, so that helical \u201Ccurrents\u201D

are preserved in the 4- to 3-D projection. And, as we\u2019ve just seen, the 6 planar sections boil down to 2 + 1

= 3 (the Lissajous figures\u2019 oscillation playing a role here akin to the dilating \u201Cthird circle\u201D used to map the

4-D orbits of the Quaternions into 3-space): i.e., to a 3-D pattern diffeomorphic to the 2-torus in 4-D.

         From what was said earlier about Peixoto\u2019s Theorem, stability of toroidal currents requires there

be two helices, with equal and rational winding numbers and opposite orientations. Assuming claims are

true, we can imagine an overarching regulation of movement through these three strata having an overall

symmetry of 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 = 120: the full symmetry group of the icosa- or dodeca- hedron. (Effect closure

by assuming that each pair in the K:Q ratio sequence cannot be \u201Ctrivial,\u201D must have its sum one greater than

its predecessor, and that the larger integer in each equals or exceeds by 1 the larger integer in the prior pair.

Then we get 2:1, 3:1, 3:2, 4:2 ? 2:1; that is, relative primality makes the sequence loop.)

         One of the greatest surprises in singularity theory after the \u201CA-D-E Problem\u201D was formulated was

the incredible degree to which correspondences between fields could be traced: in particular, the icosahed-

ral reflection group just alluded to was found to govern unfoldings in the 4-D boundary of a 16-D manifold

(one per each plane of symmetry, plus the identity), as well as being connected with the generic problem of

\u201Cbypassing an o bstacle.\u201D This latter, in turn, was shown to be anticipated \u2013 albeit not in modern language!

\u2013 in the \u201Coutdated\u201D study of the evolvents of curves pioneered by Huyghens in wave-front theory, specifi-

cally in diagrams Benniquen discovered of the evolvents of the semi-cubical parabola (itself the germ of

                                          3
the simplest, or Fold, Catastrophe Y = X ) in the very first textbook on analysis, written by L\u2019H\u00F4pital from

Bernoulli\u2019s lectures[28]. (As Arnol\u2019d understates the case, \u201Cthe appearance of the regular polyhedra is

often unexpected.\u201D)

         The former result, though, due to Lyashko[29], suggests a frontier in \u201Czero-divisor\u201D study that

remains unexplored: what connections, if any, can be elicited between the three 16-D structures we\u2019ve

seen are of interest? The superstring theorist\u2019s E8 x E8 is clearly not the same as the 16-D realization of the

icosahedral reflection group\u2019s symmetry whose (symplectic) boundary is Lyashko\u2019s focus: it is just the

direct product of two icosahedral rotation groups. But we know that H4 (the only higher-level analogue of

H3 ) has a group structure which is the direct product of two icosahedral reflection groups, and plays a key




                                                     Page 60
\u000Crole in the overarching theory of such five-fold singularities: Shcherbak\u2019s classic investigation of these in

fact shows five-fold-symmetric forms associated with H4 , H3 , and D6 [30] \u2013 the last item being shown by

Arnol\u2019d to underwrite quasicrystals and their non-algorithmizable construction via the 3-D analog of Pen-

rose tiles[31]. But this, per Andr\u00E9 Katz, lends itself to a tessellation with 22 differently decorated rhombic

tiles (of either \u201Cthick\u201D or \u201Cthin\u201D type)[32] \u2013 corresponding to the 22 \u201Cpower orbits\u201D in Mus\u00E8s\u2019 M-algebra for

the seven octonions, their corresponding spin-units (2 orbits each), plus one for \u201Ccommutative i.\u201D (The

third 16-D structure, of course, to interrelate with these, is that of Sedenion space itself.)

         The Katz/M-Algebra construct is quite suggestive, in that \u201Czero-divisors\u201D are all over the place: in

the space determined by im \u00B7 en = e[m xor n], m, n distinct, it\u2019s easy to see that points on the unit circle in the

(m,n) plane behave peculiarly: those (as well as all others) on the diagonals through the origin are square

                                                                     nth
roots of zero, and these points can, in turn, be shown to have 2           roots in higher dimensions (as Mus\u00E8s did,

with unfortunately awkward notation). These diagonal pairs, meanwhile (7*6 = 42 in number, like Sede-

nion Assessors) are asymptotes of hyperbolae, point-pairs on opposite branches of which demarcate the

axes of elliptical power-orbits \u2013 a simple enough result, the search for something kindred leading to finding

Yaglom\u2019s treatise on \u201Cparabolic geometry\u201D(Reference 22.) This simple geometric support for an infinite-

dimensional extension of Galilean relativity is (typically buried) underneath the abstract language of

\u201Cnilpotent sheaves\u201D and the like in superstring theory.

         The 16-D Lyashko singularity with boundary, especially given its close relationship to the \u201Cobsta-

cle bypass\u201D evolvent context, is quite suggestive in its own right: in particular, a novel opening to explor-

ing some recent approaches to quantum non-localization would seem indicated. Readers are encouraged to

pursue the URL and/or text version of the source containing the quotes, while keeping the \u201CLissajous ping-

pong\u201D motif broached much earlier clearly in mind. First, by implication, the \u201Cobstacle bypass\u201D problem:

         One way of explaining quantum non-locality is through a hand-shaking space-time
         interaction between an emitter and its potential absorbers. The transactional interpretation
         does just this by postulating an advanced wave travelling back in time from the [future]
         absorber to the emitter. This interferes with the retarded wave, travelling in the usual
         direction from emitter to absorber to form the exchanged particle. Because both waves
         are zero-energy crossed phase waves, they interfere destructively outside the particle path
         but constructively between the emitter and absorber. The emitter sends out an offer wave
         and the absorber responds with a confirmation wave. Together they form a photon, just as
         an anti-electron (positron) travelling backwards in time is the same as an electron
         travelling forwards.[33]




                                                       Page 61
\u000C         Second, the problem of reflective boundary conditions is explicitly pinpointed as central to the

same problematic. This is spelled out in the paragraph immediately following that just cited:

         Although the transactional interpretation is completely consistent with quantum mecha-
         nics, it leads to some very counter-intuitive ideas. When I see a distant quasar, in a sense
         the quasar radiated the photon I see long ago, only because my eye is also here to per-
         ceive it. In a sense the quasar anticipated my presence and, despite its vastly greater ener-
         gy, it may not be able to radiate without the presence of myself and the other potential
         absorbers in its very distant future. This would imply that non-locality is observer depen-
         dent in a way which prevents any single observer having access to all the boundary con-
         ditions and hence logical prediction of the outcomes. This would prevent the universe
         from being computationally or deterministically predicted, but it would not prevent quan-
         tum non-locality from displaying relationships in which future states had an influence
         through being boundary conditions.



         In summary, a third brief snippet from the same text addresses the non-algorithmicity of quasi-

crystallic ordering, and its role as mediator between the chaotic and the quantized, quite succinctly:


         The quantum suppression of chaos noted in \"scarring\" of the wave function and other
         experimental results carries quantum chaos to the edge of quasi-periodicity. This is where
         order-from-chaos computation becomes possible, as illustrated by Conway's game of life
         and consistent with Freeman's model of perception.


         III: \u201CCuspoid sequence\u201D \u2013 The simplest (because possessing but one behavior) strata are just

boxcars of minima and maxima (or straddles) strung together in an A-series chain. What is surprising is

just how high the strata are which the Double Cusp can contain: all of them, up through the 6-control A 7 ,

                 8
which unfolds X , \u201Care really and exactly in there, despite apparently requiring higher order terms than we

have considered.\u201D (Reference 18, p. 323.) Those with even numbers of controls are \u201Ccompact\u201D in Zee-

man\u2019s sense, which means that regimes can\u2019t fall off the cliff or into the sky to infinity (which, pragma-

tically, means the cuspoids with odd numbers of controls are often best thought of as incomplete \u201Cinter-

rupts\u201D requiring link-ups to something outside the ambit of the given \u201Cfigure of regulation\u201D).

         The two-control \u201CCusp\u201D is the simplest and most famous: models of such paradoxical two-control

behaviors as the rat who attacks when backed into the corner, the girl playing hard to get who succumbs

only when the boy pursuing her gives up, etc., have been produced in vast numbers since Zeeman began

teaching others to play this game. The maximal Cuspoid stratum can be thought of, then, as a stack of three

such Cusps, whose coinciding inside one stratum may be thought of as an aspect of what a programmer




                                                    Page 62
\u000Cwould call the \u201CUI\u201D and not necessarily the \u201Cbackend database.\u201D Put another way, the phenomena of real

interest may well exist in a \u201Cthree-tiered system,\u201D access to each of whose modular layers is governed

minimally by a Cusp.

         Each such tier-specific Cusp, meanwhile, can be thought of as having the capacity to arbitrarily

bond with virtually any \u201Cbehavior\u201D beyond that defining its own dynamic, or the \u201Cumbrella dynamic\u201D over-

sighting a \u201Chandshake\u201D: which \u201CY\u201D is chosen to bond with a given \u201CX,\u201D thanks to the so-called \u201CSplitting

Lemma,\u201D is of no consequence as far as dynamics are concerned. This feature is of course absolutely criti-

cal for conceiving of software implementations allowing search and retrieval, with returns of not only pre-

cisely optimized quarry allowed, but those resulting from \u201Cbricolage\u201D or \u201Csatisficing\u201D as well. The Double

Cusp, meanwhile, allows Chaos to intrude in certain controlled contexts, suggesting that search algorithms

could employ chaos-theoretic \u201Csmart controllers,\u201D as first studied by Ott, Grebogi and Yorke in 1990, in the

general case. As a pointer to interesting directions worth following, systems architect Kent Palmer has

stressed the future role one can expect from \u201Czero-divisor\u201D number theory in the construction of any com-

puterized modeling of complex social interactions.[34] But clearly, such issues require separate study.

         \u201CThree tiers\u201D is the standard way of thinking about modeling sophisticated object-oriented systems

these days \u2013 the three tiers corresponding to backend data, intermediary \u201Cbusiness logic,\u201D and user inter-

face. Each of these tiers could have its component parts scattered across any number of servers anywhere

in a global network, with each tier having a life of its own, provided interfacing with the other two is built

in as a given condition of the model. We\u2019ve no reason to expect less than this degree of flexibility here.

         An expeditious manner in which to take advantage of such potential might go like this: look for a

way to \u201Cstretch\u201D a Double Cusp (via symmetry constraints) so that the umbilic-strata machinery can pro-

vide the \u201Cmessage-passing\u201D between the tiers. The starting point for such a procedure is in a classic pair of

papers by Thom[35] from the early 70\u2019s, wherein the sequence of control-space figures discussed above

(i.e., deltoid, astroid, pentagram) are deployed on what we\u2019ll call the \u201C(T,V) screen\u201D spanned by the two

lowest-order controls (operating on X and Y respectively), under the constraint of bilateral symmetry.

         Thom didn\u2019t treat these three as sequentially appearing in the same process; instead, they figure as

\u201Cmoments\u201D in one 5-control equation, where one of the 3 higher controls must be \u201Coff\u201D to effect a space-

time unfolding. A logic paralleling that given earlier for collapsing the umbilic sequence to fit the contours




                                                     Page 63
\u000Cof H3 can be adopted, though, in what must be a \u201Ctoy model\u201D for now. Because of the symmetry constraint,

higher-order terms than are usually accessible can be controlled; in fact, in the deltoid control-space, Thom
                                                                                                        3
twiddles the equations to give, in effect, an elliptic umbilic with \u201Czoom lens\u201D: the germ of the EU (X \u2013

    2
3XY ) becomes a control, which we\u2019ll call \u201CB,\u201D working alongside the usual \u201Csignature\u201D control for the

                                          2    2
EU, which we\u2019ll call \u201CC,\u201D operating on (X + Y ). Call this scaling or focusing effect the \u201Coffering.\u201D

         In the astroid control-space, the germ of the Double Cusp itself is a control \u2013 but it is not the stan-

dard germ; rather, it includes a value of the parameter that is outside the \u201Csweet spot\u201D discussed earlier \u2013
                                                                   4       2 2       4
one equal to the Pascal coefficient attaching to its monomial: X \u2013 6X Y + Y . Call this highest-order

expression\u2019s control \u201CA.\u201D To revert to the sweet spot, the \u201C6\u201D must be tweaked to fall between \u00B12. Assume

the tweaking is effected by a resonance with a Double Cusp on an adjacent tier in our three-tiered setup: an
                                                               2                 2
\u201Coctave,\u201D say, whose behaviors X*, Y* are such that X* \u02DC X and Y* \u02DC Y , so that, when \u201CA\u201D is on, we

get the astroid in the control plane of the two lowest-order controls (those operating on X and Y) by

                                                                   2   2                      2     2
assuming the standard EU \u201CC\u201D control is \u201Con,\u201D too. (That is, X + Y \u201Cresonates with\u201D X* + Y* , with the

mixed term with coefficient \u201C6\u201D representing, in effect, the \u201Ctransaction cost.\u201D) Call this the \u201Chandshake.\u201D

         In the pentagram control-space, the sequential turning off of progressively lower controls comes to

a halt: only the two higher controls are \u201Con.\u201D But there is a \u201Cmy sterious change of sign\u201D found to be re-

quired by computer simulations: the \u201Czooming,\u201D once solicitous, now acts as a \u201Ccounterpotential.\u201D This

led to a correction in Thom\u2019s second paper \u2013 and suggests a heuristic interpretation: after the offering and

handshake, the parties to the exchange, their business now concluded, walk away. Call this the \u201Csign-off.\u201D

         As this monograph nears its own signing off, a last question must be considered: in what manner

can the above be construed as more than analogy or \u201Ctoy modeling\u201D? How, specifically, can we envision a

box-kite \u201Cdoing read/writes\u201D between two Double Cusps? The secret resides in the nature of the resonance

described: the \u201Chandshake\u201D stage.

         An early result of Double Cusp theory was the drawing of its \u201Cgeneric section\u201D in behavior space:

                                                               2
two intersecting, orthogonal ellipses, obeying the equation X \u00B1 XY + Y2 = 1. Its direct relation to the

\u201CHoly Grail\u201D sectioning of the astroid stratification (the astroid, as he reminds us, can be classically viewed

as the envelope of a family of orthogonal ellipses) is nicely shown in Chillingworth[36]. The astroid can


                                                    Page 64
\u000Calso be seen \u2013 as the \u201CHoly Grail\u201D graphic displays clearly \u2013 as the projection into 2-D of the critical edges

of a curvilinear tetrahedron separating two orthogonally oriented, mirror-imaged bowls: a tellingly literal

portrayal of just where the \u201CE6 \u201D is hiding inside the \u201CX9 \u201D!

         Suppose each \u201Cbowl\u201D (and hence, each ellipse) be seen as attaching to one of the two parties to the

\u201Chandshake\u201D resonance. How relate this to the box-kite formalism? The simplest route to answering this

could involve another result of Charles Mus\u00E8s, one for which nobody, to this author\u2019s knowledge, has yet

found a use. This concerns another sort of \u201Chypernumber,\u201D which he signified by the letter \u201Cw.\u201D (He con-

jectured there were numerous others, which also seem to bear relation to Catastrophe Theory\u2019s visual voca-

bulary; the ultimate such form, he speculated, would relate to solitons: a \u201Cmad\u201D thought which was the

original inspiration for earlier remarks made herein).

         Mus\u00E8s\u2019 \u201Cw\u201D-numbers have power-orbits which trace out the orthogonal ellipses according to the

equation in X,Y just given, but with X mapped to the reals, and Y to the \u201Cw\u201D\u2019s. The ellipse with a \u00B1XY

                                       k
tracks the exponential powers of (\u00B1w) respectively. Such orbits obey a 6-cycle (like our trefoils and triple-

zigzags); and, they are, in general, non-distributive (a trademark feature of \u201Czero-divisor\u201D arithmetic). This

much given, a method for deploying them as \u201Chook-ups\u201D between Double Cusps and box-kites suggests

itself, using the lanyards we dubbed \u201Ctray racks.\u201D These lanyards, recall, were incomplete: they came in

pairs, so that two such racks were needed to cover the \u201Cfour-cornered square\u201D such tandem structures span.

Finally, note that there are three sets of tray racks, residing in orthogonal plane sections \u2013 one such section

for each required mediation between the levels of our \u201Cthree-tiered\u201D software-system inspiration.

         Closing question: what is the relation of the \u201Ctable inequivalence\u201D (and \u201Cimmune-system respon-

siveness\u201D) of the Sedenions, and the \u201Cinfinite-codimensional chaos at the edge of the sweet spot\u201D of the

Double Cusp? Of these two, to state vector collapse? To be pursued, perhaps, at some later date . . .

                      \u201CWell, it\u2019s a long story,\u201D he said, \u201Cbut the question I would like to
                     know, is the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything.

The evolute of an astroid is another, bigger astroid: the midpoints of the latter\u2019s sides are the former\u2019s
cusps. The envelope of the family of normals to an ellipse is an astroid; the astroid, dually, is the envelope
of a family of ellipses. In the latter case, symmetry gives us the orthogonal ellipse pair with equation X2 \u00B1
XY + Y2 : the Double Cusp\u2019s \u201Cgeneric section\u201D (corresponding to a \u201Ctop view\u201D of the Holy Grail shown in
the middle above, whose bowls\u2019 cross sections are our ellipses, with their tetrahedral join projecting down
to yield the astroid). Meanwhile, Mus\u00E8s\u2019 \u201Cw-Numbers\u201D (top right) show power-orbits of (\u00B1w)k traversing
the same ellipses. (The infinite evolutive sequence of astroids, and G2 \u2019s analogous sequence of derivation
algebras for higher-order Cayley-Dixon processes, suggest a deep connection of the sort he sensed. Note,
too, his \u201Cv\u201D numbers, which just happen to attach where so-called complex \u201Cwhiskers\u201D enter the bowls of
the Grail. Mus\u00E8s changed his mind about what these \u201Cv\u201D might be; their only interest here is the peculiar
intuition of their perpetrator: somehow he was \u201Cseeing\u201D higher-dimensional patterns of Double Cusp strata,
and sensing their relationship to patterns that cut deeper. How did he do that? And: can we run with it?)

    \u201CThe space of quartics is interesting because it is one of the most accessible instances of the phenome-

    non of modality [due to Arnold]: there are infinitely many orbits, most of which fall into families hav-

    ing continuous parameters. Here the parameter is the classical J-invariant, which is closely related to

    the cross-ratio of the roots of the quartic. . . . We show that the orbits form a singular foliation, with the

    modal families being hung around a skeleton of orbits of degenerate forms, which Chillingworth has

    dubbed the Holy Grail. It is the analogue for quartics of the deltoid observed by Zeeman.\u201D

    http://exo.com/~palmer/ISSS2000ab.html; from the software architect\u2019s vantage, he argues, the pro-

    gressively less linear and ever-farther-from-equilibrium approaches emerging from Prigogine\u2019s dissi-

    pative systems, Maturana and Varela\u2019s autopoietic self-organizing systems, and the reflexive social

    special systems of John O\u2019Malley and Barry Sandwell require, respectively, complex, quarternionic,

    and octonionic modeling; but what he terms the \u201CMeta-system\u201D requires \u201Cthe Sedenion and higher

    Hyper Complex Algebras that lose the division property.\u201D(P. 44) He would seem to needlessly limit

    his agenda, however, by lumping together all such higher algebras: \u201CAll the higher algebras beyond

    the Sedenion are basically the same because there are no more interesting properties to be lost as we

    apply the Cayley-Dickson procedure to generate the even higher algebras\u201D \u2013 a view with which this

    monograph is in sharp disagreement!

    Books, Garden City, NY, 1977, pp. 280-288. Herein, Mus\u00E8s presents not so much the mathematical

    apparatus of his hypernumbers (from a formalist\u2019s perspective, it could legitimately be argued that he

    in fact never accomplished that); but rather, the vision of their purpose and raison d\u2019\u00EAtre. We offer his

    remarks as a closing thought worth mulling on: \u201CNow we come to the highest and last of any hyper-

    number which yields 1 when multiplied by itself a given number of times. Let us designate it by the

                                                                  2                  6
    symbol w. If we ascribe to w the following properties: (\u00B1w) = -1\u00B1w, and (\u00B1w) = 1, it turns out that w

    is the hypernumber that expresses the phase alterations and interactions with matter of what might be

    called pure noetic energy, both conscious and unconscious. We may call it the number of noetic

    energy. Note that, unlike 1, i, or e, the negative form of w behaves differently from its positive form,
                                 2      2
    and hence the equation (+x) = (-x) is no longer true if x is w.\u201D (Pp. 285-6) For less metaphysics, and

    more mathematical specifics, one must skim through the conjectures and unsubstantiated claims of the

    fascinating, but seldom rigorous, \u201CWorking with the Hypernumber Idea,\u201D in Charles Mus\u00E8s and Arthur

    Young, editors, Consciousness and Reality: The Human Pivot Point, Avon Books, New York, 1974,

    pp. 448-469. The w-numbers are discussed in passing here and there in Mus\u00E8s\u2019 papers cited earlier,

    and are also developed a bit (but not much) in Mus\u00E8s\u2019 Destiny and Control of Human Systems: Stu-

    dies in the Interactive Connectedness of Time (Chronotopology), Kluwer Academic, Boston,1985. In

    general, Mus\u00E8s\u2019 work sprinkles some brilliantly suggestive nuggets in a morass of irrelevancies, bla-

    tant mistakes, inflated claims, and promises of future results that never show up. (One thinks of Benoit

    Mandelbrot\u2019s remarks in The Fractal Geometry of Nature concerning Louis Zipf\u2019s largely unread

    book, from which he extracted the deep information-theoretic result called \u201CZipf\u2019s Law.\u201D) Yet such

\u000Cexcesses notwithstanding, his w-numbers (and remarks in the final appendix to \u201CWorking\u201D contrasting

Eisenstein triples with the w-number 6-cycles show his intuition truly points in this direction) would

seem to offer a glimpse at a profound method for codifying G2 arithmetically \u2013 which could have enor-

mous significance, given G2 \u2019s role as the unique derivation algebra for all extensions of the Cayley-

Dickson process.
