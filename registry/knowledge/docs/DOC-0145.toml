# Open Claims Sources (Inbox)

Purpose: provide a minimal, explicit external-sources anchor for open claims that are not yet
assigned a dedicated topic index under `docs/external_sources/`.

Policy:
- Open claims (Status contains Unverified/Speculative/Partially) should reference at least one
  `docs/external_sources/*.md` index in their \"Where stated\" cell of `docs/CLAIMS_EVIDENCE_MATRIX.md`.
- This file is an inbox-style placeholder. As a claim matures, replace this reference with a
  claim-specific or topic-specific sources index (and keep this file as a historical pointer).

Claims currently routed here (2026-02-03):
- C-043
- C-082 (resolved 2026-02-03; retained as historical pointer)
- C-087
- C-092 (resolved 2026-02-03; retained as historical pointer)
- C-094 (resolved 2026-02-03; retained as historical pointer)
- C-096 (resolved 2026-02-03; retained as historical pointer)
