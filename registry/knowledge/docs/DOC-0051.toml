# Repository Overview (Honest Audit)

This repository is a **working lab notebook** that mixes:
- executable Python experiments (under `src/`),
- generated artifacts (CSVs, plots, reports under `data/` and `curated/`),
- and narrative documents (under `docs/`).

The core theme is exploring **Cayley-Dickson algebras** (especially 16D sedenions), their
zero-divisor structure, and speculative mappings to physics. Some mathematical properties (e.g.
non-associativity beyond 8D) are standard; many physics-facing claims in the narratives are **not
validated** and should be treated as hypotheses until tied to first-party sources and
reproducible tests.

## What the codebase contains

- `src/gemini_physics/`: a small kernel library for algebra + simulation utilities (now packaged).
- `src/verification/`: scripts that check basic algebraic properties and dataset convergence.
- `src/quantum/`: Qiskit circuits and simulations (intended to run via Docker Python 3.11).
- `src/fetch_*.py`: data acquisition scripts (astronomy and other sources).
- `data/`: cached artifacts and images (including some \"grand\" plots).
- `curated/`: large CSV corpora and theory \"framework\" outputs.

## What is currently well-grounded vs. speculative

**Well-grounded (mathematics / computation):**
- Cayley-Dickson doubling produces non-associative algebras from 8D upward.
- 16D sedenions admit zero divisors and lose composition of the norm.
- de Marrais replication: 42 primitive assessors and 7 box-kites (`tests/test_de_marrais_boxkites.py`).
- Reggiani alignment: 84 \"standard\" zero divisors have annihilator nullity (4,4) (`tests/test_reggiani_standard_zero_divisors.py`).
- m3 trilinear operator: 42/168 split on octonion basis triples (`tests/test_m3_cd_transfer.py`).
- XOR-bucket necessity for observed 2-blade zero products (`tests/test_cd_xor_heuristics.py`).
- p-adic/Cantor foundations and nilpotent Jordan-type toy tools (`tests/test_padic_and_cantor.py`, `tests/test_nilpotent_orbits.py`).

**Speculative (requires verification + primary sources + tests):**
- \"Negative dimension vacuum\" mappings to astrophysical mass peaks.
- Claims of specific manifold identifications for the space of sedenion zero divisors.
- Proposed condensed-matter \"sedenionic metamaterials\" as physical realizations.

## Reproducibility entry points

- `REQUIREMENTS.md`: consolidated install targets and module-specific requirements.
- `make check`: runs `test + lint + smoke` with warnings treated as errors.
- `make test`: runs tests with warnings treated as errors.
- `make lint`: checks `src/gemini_physics` and `tests` (phased expansion planned).
- `make doctor`: environment capability report.
