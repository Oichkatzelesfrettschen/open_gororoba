# Reggiani Alignment & Replication (Computational)

**Primary source:** Silvio Reggiani, *The geometry of sedenion zero divisors* (2024), arXiv:2411.18881.

This repo focuses on computational checks that are directly testable from the algebraic side, under the
repository's fixed 16D Cayley-Dickson multiplication convention (`gemini_physics.optimized_algebra.cd_multiply_jit`).

## What is replicated (and tested)

### 1) Reggiani's ZD(S) normalization (annihilator-based)

Reggiani defines the global sets (for Cayley-Dickson algebras An; specialize to S = A4):
- `Z(S) = {(u,v) in SxS : ||u|| = ||v|| = sqrt(2) and u*v = 0}`
- `ZD(S) = {u in S : exists v in S with (u,v) in Z(S)}`

Reggiani also describes the zero divisors as:

- `Z(S) subseteq SxS`: normalized pairs whose product is zero.
- `ZD(S) subseteq S`: normalized elements with non-trivial annihilators.

In this repo, an element `u in S approx R^16` is treated as belonging to `ZD(S)` when:

- its **squared Euclidean norm** is 2 (so `||u|| = sqrt2`), and
- it has a **non-trivial left or right annihilator**, detected by matrix nullity via SVD.

Validated by: `tests/test_reggiani_alignment.py`.

### 2) \"84 standard zero divisors\" have left/right annihilator nullity 4

Reggiani's paper uses \"standard zero divisors\" to pick convenient origins for
geometric computations. In this repo, we reconstruct these 84 elements as:

- the two diagonals `(e_low +/- e_high)` for each of de Marrais' 42 primitive cross-assessors.

We verify (for all 84 elements) that:

- each lies in `ZD(S)` under the repo's normalization, and
- both the left and right annihilators have **dimension 4** (nullity 4),
  consistent with the paper's statement that the `SU(2)` fiber corresponds to the unit sphere in the annihilator subspace.

Validated by:
- `tests/test_reggiani_standard_zero_divisors.py`

### 3) Each standard diagonal has exactly 4 standard annihilating partners

For each standard diagonal-form zero divisor `u = (e_i +/- e_j)`, this repo computes the set of other
standard diagonal-form zero divisors `v` such that `u*v = 0`. Under the repo's convention, every `u`
has exactly **4** such standard partners, and those 4 vectors span `Ann_L(u)`.

This matches the \"4 partner\" presentation style seen in Reggiani's standard-table listing and is a concrete,
reproducible combinatorial shadow of the annihilator-fiber picture.

Validated by:
- `tests/test_reggiani_standard_zero_divisors.py`

## Artifact export (optional)

`src/export_reggiani_annihilator_stats.py` generates:
- `data/csv/reggiani_standard_zero_divisors.csv` (84 rows + nullities)
- `data/csv/reggiani_annihilator_nullity_distribution.csv`
- `data/csv/reggiani_standard_zero_divisor_pairs.csv` (84x4 directed annihilating partner pairs)
- `data/artifacts/images/reggiani_annihilator_nullity_3160x2820.png`
