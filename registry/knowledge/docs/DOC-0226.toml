## Parsing notes

- This report is a planning snapshot, not evidence.
- If a matrix row includes extra '|' characters, parsing may skip it.

## Metadata hygiene notes

These are *formatting* and *traceability* issues that make claim-by-claim audits harder.

- Rows with missing/weak `Where stated` pointers: 0
- Rows with legacy inline experiment tags in claim text (contains \\\\|v): 0
