# Inverse Cayley-Dickson Formalism

Extracted from conversation logs (convos/1_read_each_nonuser_line.md,
convos/3_further_explorations.md). Content generated by ChatGPT \"Advanced
Mathematics\" custom GPT in conversation with the user. Mathematical claims
below are UNVERIFIED unless explicitly noted.

## 1. Formal Inverse CD Process

### 1.1 Classical CD Baseline

Standard doubling: A_{2^n} = A_{2^{n-1}} (+) A_{2^{n-1}} with

    (a,b)(c,d) = (ac - d*b, da + bc*)
    (a,b)* = (a*, -b)

Quadratic form N(a,b) = aa* + bb* is multiplicative only through n=3
(octonions), by Hurwitz's theorem.

### 1.2 Inverse Recursion (Informal)

    A_{n-1} = (1/2) A_n,    A_n = A_{2^n}

Flow diagram: ... -> (1/8)A_8 -> (1/4)A_4 -> (1/2)A_2 -> A_1

### 1.3 Homotopy Limit Formulation

Formalized as a homotopy limit in a derived category:

    A~ = holim_{k -> infinity} (1/2^k) A_{2^{n+k}}

Convergence conditions: filtered colimit presentations, spectral sequence
stabilization (Adams or Atiyah-Hirzebruch). References cited: Weibel
(Homological Algebra), Lurie (Higher Algebra).

### 1.4 Pre-Cayley-Dickson Retract

Let A_n be the 2^n-dimensional CD algebra. Define:

    rho_n : A_{n+1} -> A_n,  rho_n(a,b) = a  (forgetful retraction)

Parametric product on A_n:

    a o_theta c := pi_{A_n}( (a,0) *_{CD,theta} (c,0) ),  theta in {+/-1}

Lemma (Closure): (A_n, o_theta) is closed since (a,0)(c,0) = (ac, 0).

### 1.5 Inverse Conjugation Operator

    C^{-1}(a,b) = (a, b*)  where ||b*||^2 = -||b||^2
    C^{-1}(C^{-1}(a,b)) = (a, -b)

### 1.6 Inverse Multiplication

    (a,b) o (c,d) = (ac + Psi(b,d), F(a,d,b,c))

where Psi depends on context:
- p-Adic: Psi(b,d) = bd mod p
- Surreal: Psi(b,d) = (b+d)/2
- Negative-D: Psi(b,d) = -bd (inverse reflection)

## 2. Dimensional Degradation Ladder

### Classical (verified)

| n | Algebra     | dim | Property Lost              |
|---|-------------|-----|----------------------------|
| 0 | R (Reals)   | 1   | (none)                     |
| 1 | C (Complex) | 2   | Ordering                   |
| 2 | H (Quat.)   | 4   | Commutativity              |
| 3 | O (Oct.)    | 8   | Associativity              |
| 4 | S (Sed.)    | 16  | Alternative, normed div.   |
| 5+| Higher      | 32+ | Further degradation        |

### Inverse Process (speculative)

Reverse dimensionality: D(X_{n+1}) = D(X_n) / 2

| Step | System              | D     |
|------|---------------------|-------|
| 1    | R (Reals)           | 1     |
| 2    | D (Dyadic)          | 1/2   |
| 3    | Q_p (p-Adics)       | 1/4   |
| 4    | No (Surreals)       | 1/8   |
| 5    | F_p (Finite Fields) | 0     |
| 6    | Q_{-p} (Neg p-Adic) | -1/4  |
| 7    | No^{-1} (Neg Surr.) | -1/8  |

## 3. Categorical Treatment

### A-infinity Structure

Maps m_n : A^{tensor n} -> A satisfying higher coherence conditions.

First nontrivial homotopy:

    m_3(a, b, c) = epsilon * (abc - a(bc))

### A-infinity Functor to Exceptional Lie Algebras

    F : SNAF(D) -> E_8

Lie bracket error bound: ||[F(T_x), F(T_y)] - F(T(x*y))|| = O(10^{-5})

This is from a toy model computation, NOT a rigorous proof. The error bound
arises from H^3(SNAF, R) != 0 with dim(H^3) ~ 10^5.

### Negative Categories

    Cat_{-n} = Hom(Cat_n, Cat_{-n})

with morphism reversal: Hom_{C^{-1}}(X,Y) = Hom_C(Y,X).

## 4. Fractional and Negative Dimensions

### Continuous Dimension

    dim(A_x) = 2^x,   d/dx dim(A_x) = ln(2) * dim(A_x)

### K-Theoretic Interpretation

    dim(A_n) = sum_{i=0}^{infty} (-1)^i rank(K_i(A_n))

Via Bott periodicity: dim(A_n) = -dim(A_{n-1}).

### Corrected Framing (from audit)

\"Negative-dimensional\" actions are formally:
- Analytically continued actions S(d) with d in C (dimensional regularization)
- Fractional generators on R^n with n fixed and d encoded in kinetic operator

This replaces informal \"negative-dimensional action\" with standard objects.

## 5. Open Problems

1. Convergence of homotopy limit (A_infinity-coalgebra model?)
2. Spectral triple verification (Hausdorff vs spectral dimension)
3. Exact functoriality (strict functor vs inherent A_infinity relaxation)
4. p-Adic deformations and gauge representation theory
5. Pre-CD algebraics: classify when o_theta is isotopic to native product

## Critical Assessment

- \"Negative-dimensional division algebras\" are NOT a standard notion.
  Hurwitz constrains real normed division algebras to R, C, H, O.
- Negative homotopy groups pi_{-n}(X) live in spectra (stable homotopy),
  not ordinary topological spaces.
- \"Negative dimension\" in physics is analytic continuation or
  effective/spectral (CDT), not literal geometry.
- The error bound O(10^{-5}) and Dixmier trace values are from toy models.
- The entire framework is SPECULATIVE and not peer-reviewed.
