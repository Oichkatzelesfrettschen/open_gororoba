## Key Content

### Bit-String Recipe for ZD Construction

Extends the XOR master key to provide a complete \"recipe\" for constructing
all zero-divisor spaces in arbitrary 2^n-ions. The recipe is driven by
bit-string operations, making it amenable to computational enumeration.

### Infinite-Dimensional Extension

Shows that the kite-chain midden construction extends indefinitely, with
each doubling level adding a new layer of ZD structure. The \"recipe\" provides
a constructive proof that ZD patterns are self-similar across dimension
doublings.

### Key Results

- The bit-string recipe reproduces all known ZD structures for sedenions (16D)
  and pathions (32D) and predicts the structure for chingons (64D) and beyond.
- The construction is inherently recursive: ZDs in 2^{N+1}-ions are built
  from those in 2^N-ions by applying generator-based index transformations.
- The \"carry-bit overflow\" phenomenon (the source of ZDs beyond the octonions)
  is traceable through bit-string patterns, connecting to cellular automata.
