# MCP and Skill Audit (2026-02-09)

## Scope

Audit and reconcile:

- MCP server configurations across Codex, Gemini, Copilot, and Claude CLI/Desktop.
- Existing skill coverage vs. `open_gororoba` repo needs.
- Additional useful MCP servers from primary sources.
- New granular skill pack for MCP operations and repo-specific workflows.

## Key Findings

### 1. Cross-client MCP topology was partially fragmented

- Rich config existed in `~/.claude/.mcp.json` and `~/.config/github-copilot/mcp-servers.json`.
- Leaner configs existed in:
  - `~/.gemini/settings.json`
  - `~/.copilot/mcp-config.json`
  - `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
  - `~/.codex/mcp-config.json`

### 2. Unique server inventory (all configs combined)

31 unique server names were detected:

- `arxiv`
- `bash`
- `blackarch-audit`
- `calculator`
- `chrome-devtools`
- `containers`
- `context7`
- `desktop-commander`
- `dotfiles-orchestrator`
- `fetch`
- `file-finder`
- `filesystem`
- `git`
- `github`
- `markitdown`
- `math`
- `memory`
- `ollama`
- `playwright`
- `postgres`
- `puppeteer`
- `python`
- `ripgrep`
- `rust`
- `rust-docs`
- `semgrep`
- `sequential-thinking`
- `shell`
- `sqlite`
- `time`
- `youtube-transcript`

### 3. Server import completed (safe subset)

Imported additional servers into the leaner configs:

- `desktop-commander`
- `dotfiles-orchestrator`
- `calculator`
- `file-finder`
- `markitdown`
- `math`
- `puppeteer`
- `sequential-thinking`
- `semgrep`

Updated files:

- `~/.gemini/settings.json`
- `~/.copilot/mcp-config.json`
- `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- `~/.codex/mcp-config.json`

Backups created automatically:

- `~/.gemini/settings.json.bak-20260208_221739`
- `~/.copilot/mcp-config.json.bak-20260208_221739`
- `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json.bak-20260208_221739`
- `~/.codex/mcp-config.json.bak-20260208_221739`

Post-import result:

- Each of the four target files now has 27 configured MCP servers.

## Skills Audit

### Existing skill baseline before this pass

- Existing Codex skills: 37
- MCP-focused naming coverage: limited and mostly indirect

### New skill pack created in this pass

30 new standardized skills were created under `~/.codex/skills` and validated:

MCP granular skills (22):

1. `mcp-filesystem-workflow`
2. `mcp-bash-workflow`
3. `mcp-git-workflow`
4. `mcp-github-workflow`
5. `mcp-fetch-workflow`
6. `mcp-context7-workflow`
7. `mcp-arxiv-workflow`
8. `mcp-youtube-transcript-workflow`
9. `mcp-ripgrep-workflow`
10. `mcp-playwright-workflow`
11. `mcp-puppeteer-workflow`
12. `mcp-sqlite-workflow`
13. `mcp-time-workflow`
14. `mcp-calculator-math-workflow`
15. `mcp-file-finder-workflow`
16. `mcp-markitdown-workflow`
17. `mcp-ollama-workflow`
18. `mcp-containers-workflow`
19. `mcp-dotfiles-workflow`
20. `mcp-sequential-thinking-workflow`
21. `mcp-semgrep-workflow`
22. `mcp-shell-workflow`

`open_gororoba` repo-specialized skills (8):

1. `gororoba-rust-workflow`
2. `gororoba-claims-evidence-workflow`
3. `gororoba-registry-workflow`
4. `gororoba-artifacts-workflow`
5. `gororoba-provenance-workflow`
6. `gororoba-publication-workflow`
7. `gororoba-visualization-workflow`
8. `gororoba-mcp-orchestrator`

Validation:

- All 30 pass `quick_validate.py` from the system `skill-creator` tooling.

Cross-client skill sync:

- The same 30 skills were mirrored to:
  - `~/.gemini/skills/`
  - `~/.copilot/skills/`

This keeps skill semantics aligned across Codex, Gemini, and Copilot environments.

### Claude agent pack for MCP workflows

12 Claude agent profiles were added under `~/.claude/agents/general-purpose/`:

1. `mcp-filesystem-agent.md`
2. `mcp-bash-agent.md`
3. `mcp-ripgrep-agent.md`
4. `mcp-fetch-research-agent.md`
5. `mcp-context7-agent.md`
6. `mcp-arxiv-agent.md`
7. `mcp-playwright-agent.md`
8. `mcp-sqlite-agent.md`
9. `mcp-semgrep-agent.md`
10. `gororoba-rust-agent.md`
11. `gororoba-claims-agent.md`
12. `gororoba-mcp-orchestrator-agent.md`

## Primary-Source MCP References Used

Core MCP and server baseline:

- https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers
- https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/postgres
- https://modelcontextprotocol.io/integrations

Additional high-value servers and managed integrations:

- https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep-mcp
- https://docs.docker.com/manuals/mcp/
- https://developers.notion.com/docs/mcp
- https://linear.app/docs/mcp
- https://docs.gitlab.com/user/gitlab_duo/mcp_server/
- https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-mcp

## Recommended Additional MCP Servers (next wave)

For this repo and similar research-engineering repos, the next high-value additions are:

- `postgres` (for structured evidence and experiment metadata, if `DATABASE_URL` is set)
- `github` (when token policy is standardized across all clients)
- managed integration servers as needed by workflow:
  - Notion (spec and planning sync)
  - Linear (issue and roadmap sync)
  - GitLab MCP server (if mirrored repos or CI traces are there)
  - Sentry MCP (if runtime observability is introduced)

## Operational Notes

- This pass intentionally excluded automatic import of `postgres` to the lean configs because it is env-sensitive (`DATABASE_URL`) and can fail startup if unset.
- `shell` was also left out of the auto-import set to avoid introducing a lower-safety fallback where higher-level MCP tools already exist.
- Codex runtime currently loads MCP from `~/.codex/config.toml`; `~/.codex/mcp-config.json` was still aligned for cross-tool parity and easier future migration.

## Summary

- MCP config parity significantly improved across clients.
- 30 new skills were created and validated, including 22 granular MCP operation skills and 8 repo-specific orchestration skills.
- Primary-source references were collected for both current and next-wave MCP integrations.
