# Requirements: Materials Datasets

For reproducible, keyless materials-science property datasets, prefer sources with clear licensing.

Recommended starting points (see `docs/BIBLIOGRAPHY.md` for provenance and citations):
- JARVIS-DFT (CC BY 4.0)
- OQMD (CC BY 4.0, API/OPTiMaDe)
- NOMAD (public archive, CC BY 4.0)

This repo provides scripts to download and cache small, test-friendly subsets.

```bash
make install
make artifacts-materials
```
