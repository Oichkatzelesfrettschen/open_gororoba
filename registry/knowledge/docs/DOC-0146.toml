The \u201CSomething From Nothing\u201D Insertion Point: Where NKS Research
 into Physics Foundations Can Expect the \u201CMost Bang for the Buck\u201D
                      Robert de Marrais rdemarrais@alum.mit.edu

1: Introducing the \u201CBox-Kite Papers\u201D and Zero-Divisors Generally
         The focus of this presentation is the largely unexplored subject of \u201Czero-divisors,\u201D
(henceforth, \u201CZD's\u201D) which are forms of (hypercomplex) imaginary numbers with the
peculiar property that two such, if chosen properly, are both substantial quantities \u2013 yet
they have, as their product, nothing. Like the gnarly \u201Ccoastline curves\u201D classical analysis
dismissed as \u201Cmonstrosities\u201D until Mandelbrot tamed them, then generalized \u201Cfractals\u201D
from the examples they offered, such algebraic beasts have been deemed \u201Cpathological\u201D
ever since a celebrated proof of Hurwitz's showed, a little over a century ago, that such
entities are not just oddballs, but unavoidable.1 (And, a little less than seven years ago,
the Mexican mathematician Guillermo Moreno2 showed more: in the 16-D imaginaries
called \u201CSedenions\u201D where we're first forced to deal with them, ZD's conform to some
remarkably familiar algebraic patterns which have echoes in all higher, 2N-dimensional,
extensions of imaginaries. This led immediately to my own research, and a series of three
monographs and counting which I call, for visually intuitive reasons I'll get to in short
order, the \u201Cbox-kite papers,\u201D shorthanded herein as BK1, BK2, and BK3 respectively.3)
         What Hurwitz showed in 1896 marked the end, in one key sense, of the revolution
begun in the 1810's by taking those entities Descartes had derisively deemed \u201Cimaginary\u201D
seriously. The stupendously deep rethinking of all mathematics they facilitated in the
hands of Gauss, Galois, Fourier, Reimann, et al., led some people to suspect a general
strategy: after many years' frustration, William Rowan Hamilton was able to generalize
the 2-D algebraic geometry of the complex plane to the 4-D context which the science of
mechanics, as he envisioned it, required: in a fit of inspiration, he carved the famous
formula \u201Ci2 = j2 = k2 = ijk = -1\u201D with a penknife on the bridge he was crossing. What
made finding this easy equation so difficult is this codicil: ij = -ji, and ditto for jk (and
-kj) and ki (and -ik), which is to say Quaternion multiplication is anti-commutative.
         Those familiar with the Feynman lectures will know, though, that this is precisely
what's required for a basis of vectors describing the way real forces work (which the great
Brooklyn physicist was wont to demonstrate by rotating books and other objects in two
different senses, in differing sequence, in class). If losing the commutative law of mul-
tiplication is the price you pay, then, for the calculus of dot and cross products (without
which Maxwell's equations, among other things, would hardly be thinkable), why com-
plain? And some contemporaries of Hamilton not only didn't grumble, but they sought to
push the envelope even further, which led Cayley and Dickson and Graves to double
dimension once again, yielding the 8-D Octonions, wherein even the associative law
breaks down. This means, among other things, that their symmetries can't even be codi-
fied with group theory, since simple expressions like \u201Cabc\u201D become suddenly problema-
tic: for, generally speaking, a\u00B7(b\u00B7c) and (a\u00B7b)\u00B7c may well have opposite signs! (Hence,
algebraists concerned with such things speak of \u201Cloops\u201D not groups, which do for
nonassociative operations what groups ought to do but can't!4)


R. de Marrais                              Page 1               \u201CSomething From Nothing\u201D
\u000C        Algebraically, the number fields of Imaginaries, Quaternions, and Octonions (usu-
ally indicated by C for complex, H for Hamilton, and O) all conform to a \u201Csquares rule\u201D:
expressing, say, an arbitrary complex number as z = a + bi, and another as z' = c + di, we
take for granted that the absolute value of their product is equal to the product of their ab-
solute values (i.e., it \u201Chas a norm\u201D); alternatively, writing things out in terms of compo-
nents, we get a relationship between squares (i.e., \u201Cthe product of one sum of two squares
by another is a sum of two squares as well\u201D): (ac \u2013 bd)2 + (ad + bc)2 = (a2 + b2)(c2 + d2)
        This generalizes to sums of 4 and 8 squares, for Quaternions and Octonions in that
order, and the formulas, while excruciatingly tedious to calculate in the pre-computer
days when Cayley and company were investigating all this, are conceptually, at least,
rather easy to grasp. People naturally wanted to keep doubling dimensions, to find even
weirder and niftier number fauna, but Hurwitz spoiled their fun by showing that one more
doubling to 16-D induces the loss of something even more critical than associativity: the
very notion of a norm (and hence possibility of a straightforward \u201Csquares rule\u201D5) goes out
the window. That is, defining a metric (and hence, standard \u201Cfield\u201D structure) becomes
problematic; corollarily, you get zero-divisors (i.e., number-theoretic \u201Cblack holes\u201D).
        That last parenthetical remark, though, suggests a context wherein Sedenions, and
even higher 2N-ions, might prove of real use: studying quantum gravity. Of the many
aspects of the latter that make it hard to integrate with standard QM, one in particular
makes the breakdown of norms spring to mind: the index of what we might call an
electron's \u201Cself-absorption,\u201D the \u201Cfine structure constant\u201D of 1/137, has analogues for the
weak and strong forces, but for gravity the \u201Cconstant\u201D in fact is a variable! A survey by
three Estonian physicists of Nonassociative Algebras in Physics frames this in terms of
\u201Cinfobarriers,\u201D or \u201Ccertain limits in obtaining information\u201D \u2013 related to the degree of
\u201Chypercomplexity\u201Drequired to study their limit-case phenomena (linked in turn to certain
limit-case constants, such as Einstein's c and Planck's h, for C and H respectively):

       Complex numbers seem to have a fundamental connection with the special
       theory of relativity allowing to introduce the light cone and a
       nondetermined interval for events. The noncommutativity of QM is
       related to the uncertainty relations and the complementarity principle, and
       is characteristically represented by the quaternion units satisfying the same
       commutation relations as do the angular momentum operators.6

         The authors also discuss Octonionic arguments advanced since the 1970's to
model a third infobarrier, associated with the strong force: quark confinement. And
clearly, Octonionic modeling has been running rampant since the advent of superstrings
and M-Theory, where a stress that sometimes verges on \u201Cnegative theology\u201D is placed
upon the implications of certain kinds of non-observability.7 But more germane here is a
brief \u201Cblue sky\u201D piece by Andrei Sakharov8 concerning an underlying spacetime \u201Clattice\u201D
structure (the lattice constant being the Planck length) subtending gravity, linked to a
spontaneous, post-Big Bang, phase transition \u2013 with gravity as some kind of elasticity of
this lattice (and hence of its \u201Cmetric\u201D). Our Estonian authors see a role here in studying
this fourth infobarrier involving the Sedenions \u2013 at which point, their book ends, and my
own thoughts (with progressively emerging links to NKS modeling) begin . . .

R. de Marrais                              Page 2               \u201CSomething From Nothing\u201D
\u000C         The Estonians play with various preparations of Sedenions which serve to mute or
suppress their distinctive zero-divisor features: \u201Cbinary\u201D and \u201Cternary\u201D Sedenion schemes
which can be almost tamed by matrix methods, etc. This is understandable, as they were
thinking about \u201Cinfobarriers\u201D at a time when ZD's still seemed \u201Cpathological.\u201D But the
history of the hypercomplex should suggest to us that even the loss of structure implicit in
ZD's portends some unsuspected gain in other aspects. Just what might this be? The
answer is quite surprising: contrary to a century's intuition in this area, what I find is a
tendency toward spontaneous cobbling together of ever more elaborate structure as the N
in 2N-ions gets bigger; more, that this \u201Cmustering\u201D (and its reverse process, which I think
of \u2013 to continue the military analogy \u2013 as \u201Cdemobilizing\u201D) is necessarily interlinked with
the survival of \u201Cclassical\u201D structures (specifically, associative triplets, clones of the Qua-
ternions' \u201Ci, j, k\u201D , which interpenetrate in a manner at once remarkably simple, yet ex-
ceedingly rich from a modeler's vantage), in cloistered algebraic \u201Csafe-houses\u201D whose
building blocks are the octahedral lattices of ZD's I call \u201Cbox-kites.\u201D
         From here on out, I will have much less to say about physics per se, and much
more about mustering as a general NKS phenomenon. Indeed, the title of this presenta-
tion was submitted while I was still framing BK3 \u2013 but, much to my surprise, the physics
focus of the results presented therein took shape much more quickly than anticipated,
leading me to feel far less interested in regurgitating results just written up. So I only
note briefly two key themes. First, the algebraic \u201Chomomorphism\u201D Moreno found was to
the automorphism group of the Octonions, known in Dynkin-diagram argot as \u201CG2\u201D; but
this is the same 7-fold-symmetric patterning which Dominic Joyce has used to model the
7 \u201Ccurled up\u201D dimensions of \u201Cgauge forces\u201D in M-Theory \u2013 and this \u201CJoyce manifold\u201D is
built upon 35 equations. (Also the number of associative triplets in the Sedenions: the
Octonions have 7; the Quaternions, but 1; and 2N-ions in general have (2N-1)(2N-2)/(3!).)
Second, the breakdown of the \u201Csquares law\u201D beyond the Octonions opens out on a way of
thinking surprisingly akin to renormalization: if the product of a pair of 2N-ions seems to
need the number of dimensions in which 2N+1-ions live, and if \u201Clook-alike\u201D algebras incor-
porate \u201Csleeper-cell structures\u201D (i.e., dormant ZD's whose ZD-ness is unobservable as
such), with the same multiplication tables as Quaternions and Octonions, but with their
probabilistic nature implicit in (not superimposed upon) their workings . . . if such ideas
are of interest to you, please go to BK3. For I'll have no more to say about them here.
         What I do want from physics, to start with, is what one philosopher of science has
called a \u201Cremote analogy\u201D9: one which, if not taken too literally, can help guide our
thoughts into the strange terrain we're entering. I refer to the cosmological notion which
has only been taken seriously for about 4 years now, known as \u201Cco-evolution.\u201D Since
John Kormandy's presentation at the June, 2000, AAS meeting, it has suddenly become a
mainstream notion to see supermassive black holes as \u201Cgalactic sculptors\u201D \u2013 that is,
necessary ingredients in galactic evolution, at least for elliptic galaxies like ours, with a
clear correlation between the size of the central black hole and the galaxy itself.10 I invite
you to jettison the \u201Ccommon wisdom\u201D of ZD's as \u201Cpathological,\u201D and imagine an indefi-
nitely large (in theory, up to infinite-dimensional) space of ZD's \u2013 replete with a vast
potential for \u201Cmustering\u201D and \u201Cdemobilizing\u201D structures, be they evanescent or long-term,
guided by a \u201Cdark matter halo\u201D of NKS protocols still to be determined \u2013 as the \u201Csuper-
massive black holes\u201D which center and structure the galaxies of number.

2: The Theory of Everything: Starter-Kit Concepts
        BK3 ends with two pages presenting and generalizing from a \u201Csynchronization
table\u201D displaying a fundamental property I call \u201Ctrip-sync,\u201D for short for synchronization
of associative triplets (a.k.a., systems of mutually interpenetrating Quaternion copies).
Other phenomena (in particular, the \u201Csand mandalas\u201D in the 32-D \u201CPathions,\u201D whose
graphical sequencing in BK2 \u2013 reproduced below \u2013 was the first clue to NKS behaviors)
suggested complexity in the NKS sense. But the \u201Cspin control\u201D implicit in the \u201Cslippage\u201D
between triplets sharing Box-Kite pathways shows us where it's hiding and what it feeds
on. As happens surprisingly often in mathematics, being an inch away from a Big Idea
can feel like a mile until you get there, so while the closing thought in BK3 was that it
was an open question whether the Trip-Sync property holds for ZD patterns in all 2n-ions,
n > 3, it turned out to be embarrassingly easy to prove it in full generality, using nothing
much more than the defining properties of Box-Kite lattices themselves. So Trip-Sync's
deployment will mark the end-point of the presentation here of the \u201Cstarter-kit concepts\u201D
\u2013 after which, the \u201Cwork in progress\u201D of \u201Cmustering theory\u201D proper can be broached.
        To get to a point where \u201Ctrip-sync\u201D will seem a natural thing to contemplate, we
need to consider, first, notation; next, the Cayley-Dixon Process (or CDP), the algorithm
which allows us to build 2N+1-ions from 2N-ions for N arbitrarily large; then, Box-Kites
themselves, which the right notation will make easy to explain, and ensembles of which,
in higher-than-16 dimensions, CDP machinery will let us investigate and navigate with
minimal pain.
        While the Quaternions have but two distinct representations, hence two labeling
schemes (ij = k, or ik = j), the Octonions have no fewer than 480, and the Sedenions a
few hundred billion. Nor are all the Octonionic schemes simply \u201Cequivalent\u201D in all situa-
tions; nor are arbitrary labeling schemes for the Sedenions necessarily useful or even
feasible for our purposes. (For details, see BK1.) Some culling is in order, and a guiding
principle to motivate it. It is found in an outrageously simple-minded convention \u2013
highly suggestive, in formal outline, of the definition of \u201Cnorm\u201D governing number forms
less \u201Chyper\u201D than Sedenions: for the 2N units in a given universe of 2N-ions, label their
axes with subscripts running from 0 (for the reals) to 2N-1, so that products of two such
units will have indices equal to the XOR of the indices of their factors. This is not only
do-able for all N, but simple to work with to boot.
        For the Quaternions, the rule is trivial: instead of i, j, k, write i1 , i2 , i3; and, since
1 xor 2 = 3, the product of any pair of axes yields the third. What's not so trivial is the
sign, though, of the resultant unit. And since, with the Octonions, multiple labeling
schemes conforming to our XOR rule are possible (and actually in use), we choose that
one which results from the most straightforward deployment of CDP. For more than you
probably care to know about this algorithm, see the background discussion and \u201Cbit-twid-
dling\u201D proofs in BK2. For now, I'll just provide a standard, readily generalized, way of
writing Octonion triplets, then expand my interest to embrace the Sedenion multiplication
table; the iterative procedure one can point to in moving from the one to the other will
suggest a very simple set of rules (even dumber than those I reduced things to in BK2) for
any 2N-ion tabulations, which I'll describe in ready-to-implement pseudocode fashion.


R. de Marrais                                 Page 4                 \u201CSomething From Nothing\u201D
\u000C       As composing strings of subscripted \u201Ci\u201D's is quite tedious, let's just write the
indices in comma-delimited, parenthesized lists of 3, in cyclical order. Put the lowest
index number first, then the index whose product with it yields the positive value of the
third. The Quaternions' \u201Ci, j, k\u201D hence gets signified this way: (1, 2, 3). The seven
associative triplets (henceforth, \u201CO-trips\u201D) found in the Octonions are written thus:

              (1, 2, 3); (1, 4, 5); (1, 7, 6); (2, 4, 6); (2, 5, 7); (3, 4, 7); (3, 6, 5)

         Note two things: first, each such triplet is clearly \u201CXOR compliant\u201D per my ear-
lier remarks \u2013 scanning the list right to left, 3 xor 6 ( = 011 xor 110 = 101) = 5; 3 xor 4
( = 011 xor 100 = 111) = 7; ... Second, this particular mode of XOR compliance displays
2 triplets (bolded in red) where counting and cyclical orders differ: (1, 7, 6) and (3, 6, 5)
yield the wrong signs as we cycle through their products if we write them (1, 6, 7) and (3,
5, 6). Labelings are possible (and actually in use among some physicists) where only one
triplet is written \u201Cout of order\u201D; it is not possible, however, to come up with a labeling
where counting order and product signing are in accord in all 7 instances.
         The Sedenions include the 7 O-trips, but also contain 28 other associative triplets
(henceforth, \u201CS-trips\u201D) which I now list (again red-bolding those \u201Cout of order\u201D):

       (1, 8, 9)                 (1, 11, 10)               (1, 13, 12)               (1, 14, 15)
       (2, 8, 10)                (2, 9, 11)                (2, 14, 12)               (2, 15, 13)
       (3, 8, 11)                (3, 10, 9)                (3, 15, 12)               (3, 13, 14)
       (4, 8, 12)                (4, 9, 13)                (4, 10, 14)               (4, 11, 15)
       (5, 8, 13)                (5, 12, 9)                (5, 10, 15)               (5, 14, 11)
       (6, 8, 14)                (6, 15, 9)                (6, 12, 10)               (6, 11, 13)
       (7, 8, 15)                (7, 9, 14)                (7, 13, 10)               (7, 12, 11)

         For the first column only, all triplets display both counting and signing order, so
that the xor of the smaller pair of indices is identical to their sum. This is directly related
to the workings of CDP: for the key is the middle term in each, namely 8 = 23. The unit
corresponding to this index is the CDP generator: in general, to get 2N+1-ions from their
predecessor 2N-ions, you affix a unit of index 2N and produce 2N-1 triplets as above. All
such generator-containing triplets are, from the vantage of ZD creation, sterile. Indeed, it
is this sterility which leads to the very simple production rule for creating arbitrary zero-
divisors: take any arbitrary Octonion of index o (7 choices); then take any Sedenion of
index S, such that S is neither 8 nor the xor of o with 8 (6 choices); the diagonal lines in
the ( o, S ) plane (one of the 7\u00B76 = \u201C42 Assessors\u201D) will have all their points be ZD's.
         The tricky part is figuring out which diagonals zero-divide with which. This is
quite different from the situation found in standard QM, where a special (and, from our
purview, degenerate) case of ZD's has a crucial role to play. If we de-reify the usual
operator formalism to reveal the \u201Cinner number theory\u201D trying to get out, we can see that
the \u201Cprojection operators\u201D underwriting spin-up vs. spin-down options, for instance, are
idempotents which just happen to mutually annihilate each other when multiplied (i.e.,
they're ZD's with respect to each other). They define two diagonal lines, with each point
of one zero-dividing each point of the other. Now let's say this again, in simpler English.

R. de Marrais                                  Page 5                    \u201CSomething From Nothing\u201D
\u000C        We know that a Complex \u201Cline\u201D is really a plane; the product of two such lines,
then, is really a 4-space. This space is not navigated by the Quaternions, since it's pro-
duced by 2 real axes and 2 imaginaries; but: in one of the great magic acts of modern
mathematics, this \u201Cbicomplex\u201D 4-space (as navigated by the \u201Cunitary rotation group\u201D
\u201CSU2\u201D) is isomorphic to the Quaternions. The \u201Cbicomplex\u201D space is also the simplest
interesting case of the general associative vector space called a Clifford algebra (the one
dubbed \u201CCl2,\u201D since it has 22 dimensions, to be precise). Its axes include the usual real
and imaginary; but the other two are \u201Cmirror numbers\u201D (they square to +1, not \u2013 1), and a
form of i which operates commutatively on the other axes' units. This last is represented
by 2 x 2 matrices with the usual i replacing the 1's in the identity matrix. And since
Wolfgang Pauli's day, the \u201Cmirror numbers\u201D (one kind corresponding to each Quaternion
unit) have been represented by the trio of 2 x 2 \u201CPauli spin matrices.\u201D (All 3 of these, plus
the Quaternions, plus the \u201Ccommutative imaginaries,\u201D together span the 8-D space called
\u201CCl3\u201D; we won't be needing to know about this here, though, fortunately!)
        If we signify \u201Cmirror numbers\u201D by the letter m, then the standard projection opera-
tors can be written thus: \u00BD(1 + m). It's easy to show that, for each of these quantities,
raising it to any arbitrary power leaves it unchanged; hence, each operates along its diago-
nal in the (1, m) plane like the '1' on the real axis \u2013 which is to say, it's idempotent. It's
also easy to see that their product (and hence that of any point on the one diagonal times
any on the other) displays nilpotency as well, since (1 + m)(1 \u2013 m) = 1 + m \u2013 m \u2013 1 = 0.
        The diagonals of the 42 planes I've called \u201CAssessors\u201D in the Sedenions are like-
wise ZD's, but with a difference: they never mutually zero-divide, and they only zero-
divide with points on one or the other (but never both) diagonals in some other Assessors.
And we can narrow this down further: they only zero-divide with four other Assessors, in
such a manner that points on the \u201C\\\u201D diagonal in one will zero-divide with points on one
of another Assessor's diagonals, while the \u201C/\u201D diagonal will zero-divide with the other.
        More specific yet: unlike \u201Cprojection operators,\u201D which always come in pairs,
Assessor planes containing mutually zero-dividing diagonals come in threes. And, since
each Assessor participates in two such (otherwise unconnected) trios, it turns out that the
simplest layout is actually the one followed: i.e., the ZD activity of each Assessor is con-
strained within an octahedral arrangement of four \u201CCo-Assessor trios,\u201D where each vertex
represents an Assessor plane, and the trios only share vertices, not edges, with each other.
        Note, too, the \u201Cedge signs,\u201D indicating which diagonals form ZD's with which,
when two Assessors joined by an edge are considered: if diagonals must have the same
orientation (\u201C \\ \u00B7 \\ \u201D or \u201C / \u00B7 / \u201D), mark the edge \u201C+\u201D; otherwise, write \u201C\u2013 \u201D. Then color in
the 4 triangles whose edges form \u201Cclosed cycles\u201D (for vertices A, B, C, each Assessor
pairing \u201Cemanates\u201D the third: e.g., ( SA , oA ) \u00B7 ( SB , oB ) = + ( SC , oC ) \u2013 ( SC , oC ) = 0) and
call them \u201CSails.\u201D Call the other 4 \u201CVents,\u201D and you get an octahedral \u201CBox-Kite\u201D which
can fly in Sedenion winds. 7 such, all isomorphic, partition the 42 Assessors, each taking
6; from these simple structures, the entire \u201Cpathology\u201D of Sedenion ZD's can be grasped.
        The monicker \u201CBox-Kite\u201D is further justified by the fact that while the real-world
variety have wooden struts separating opposite vertices, thereby creating support and sta-
bility sufficient to let them fly, \u201Cstruts\u201D provide the crucial ingredient in our ethereal Box-
Kites as well: the 3 pairs of Assessors joined by \u201Cstruts\u201D do not mutually zero-divide!

         Struts have another major property: products of all 3 \u201Cstrut pairs\u201D in a Box-Kite
obey the same pattern; the (o, S) multiplications always yield the generator (the index-8
unit in the Sedenions); the (o, o) and (S, S) pairings, though, always result in the \u201Cmissing
Octonion\u201D (since an Octonion index resides at each vertex, of which there are 6, one must
be absent!) which serves as the signature, or \u201Cstrut constant,\u201D of the Box-Kite in question.
To differentiate it from an index proper, I write it with a Roman numeral, as shown in the
left-most column in the \u201CStrut Table\u201D above.
         The 12 \u201Cedge-signs,\u201D drawn above right on the Box-Kite, evenly divide between
\u201C+\u201D and \u201C\u2013 \u201D; but \u201C\u2013 \u201D's cluster in such a manner as to form the edges of two opposite
faces of the octahedron, one of which is a Vent, the other a Sail. The convention here is
to assume this Sail is ABC (making its corresponding Vent DEF). This special Sail I call
the \u201CZigzag,\u201D since traversing the edges so that one always \u201Cmakes zero\u201D creates a 6-cycle
of flipflopped traversals: multiply mutual ZD's from A and B, then B and C, then C and
A, and begin, say, with the \u201C\\\u201D; the lines picked will keep switching like this: \u201C\\ / \\ / \\ /\u201D.
         Let's make this concrete: consider the Zigzag of Box-Kite I. Start with the \u201C/\u201D
diagonal in A's plane (which the table tells us is spanned by i3 and i10 ), and proceed as just
indicated. Here's the actual 6-cycle of ZD products (ignoring constants, since any points
on the indicated lines will serve as well as any others):
                           (i3 + i10)(i6 \u2013 i15) = (i6 \u2013 i15)(i5 + i12) = (i5 + i12)(i3 \u2013 i10) =
                        (i3 \u2013 i10)(i6 + i15) = (i6 + i15)(i5 \u2013 i12) = (i5 \u2013 i12)(i3 + i10) = 0.

        The other 3 Sails (ADE, FCE and FDB) all have 2 \u201C+\u201D's and just one \u201C\u2013 \u201D for
edge-signs. Their 6-cycle patterns \u2013 \u201C\\ \\ \\ / / /\u201D or \u201C/ / / \\ \\ \\\u201D \u2013 suggest the knots they're
named for: Trefoils. This Zigzag/Trefoil difference is the basis of the Trip-Sync property;
all we need do now is consider the O-trips and S-trips which Sails are made of, and \u201Cblow
up\u201D each Sail into a kindred \u201CBox-Kite\u201D layout. Only on these, \u201CSails\u201D now represent the
4 distinct triplets weaving through a Co-Assessor trio, with the sole O-trip cast in the
\u201CZigzag\u201D role, and the 3 (o, S) pairs which span Assessor planes bounding the \u201Cstruts.\u201D

R. de Marrais                                           Page 7                         \u201CSomething From Nothing\u201D
\u000C        This is much easier to follow by seeing it than hearing it described. So let's take
as for-instance the Zigzag of Box-Kite I. Its 3 Assessors' ( o, S ) pairs have the indices
given in the prior page's \u201CStrut Table\u201D: (3, 10); (6,15); and (5, 12). The 3 o's comprise
one of the standard O-trips; but the \u201Crecursive Box-Kite\u201D described last paragraph (or
\u201CRbox\u201D for short) shows that each of these 3 o's forms an S-trip with the other two trio
members' Sedenions. Hence (3, 15, 12); (10, 6, 12); (10, 15, 5) \u2013 written in A, B, C order
with the Octonions in bold \u2013 are all S-trips we can find in the listings given above.
        Two differences should be noted between a Sedenion Box-Kite (\u201CSbox\u201D) and the
Rboxes one can build on its Sails. First, \u201Cdouble covering\u201D: the Sbox \u201CSails\u201D are 6-
cycles, those of an Rbox are 3-cycles. Second, \u201Cmutual mirroring\u201D: the orientation of the
cycling (as indicated by the arrows inscribed along the diagram's edges) is reversed when
one moves between Rbox and Sbox representations. This is a side-effect of two things
which are ultimately the same thing: \u201Cbit-twiddling\u201D (pure Sedenions must be written
with an extra bit when we XOR them, so that the XOR of two S's is always an o); and,
diagonal skewing (the Sbox places S-terms, which flow with the o-term's cycle in the
Sbox, on the other end of the strut the o and S terms span in the Rbox).
        The \u201Cmutual mirroring,\u201D then, is an artefact of the Rbox representation. But it
serves to indicate the nature of the property we're after: for orientation-reversal is what
Trip-Sync is all about. Reverting to the Sbox we started with, the o's at each vertex of a
Sail belong to 2 different triplets; in the Zigzag's case, irregardless of the added \u201Cweight\u201D
the S-trips carry (an extra bit to the left when we write their indices in binary), the orien-
tation is unchanged as we move from O-trip to S-trip. Hence, we could imagine a sort of
\u201Cslippage\u201D as we define Quaternionic orbits deformable into the simple i,j,k cycling round
ABC, wherein the extra bit is \u201Cadded\u201D or \u201Cdropped\u201D without our being cognizant of that
fact. If the two orientations be thought akin to QM-like \u201Cspin up\u201D vs. \u201Cspin down,\u201D we
could even claim there was an \u201Cinfobarrier\u201D forbidding us to detect which case obtained.
        We cannot say the same, though, in the general case: for, with Trefoils, S-trip to
O-trip \u201Cslippage\u201D causes a reversal of orientation, whenever the o shared between them is
not one of the Zigzag's trio (i.e., 2 times out of 3). Consider, for instance, the ADE Sail
in Box-Kite I. Writing the S-trips per above (with O-trip components in bold), we get
this: (3, 13, 14); (10, 4, 14); (10, 13, 7), with each triplet in A, D, E order. A quick look
at the earlier listing indicates that the second and third of these are written in backwards
order, whereas the first (which shares the 3 with ABC) can be \u201Clet slip\u201D without our notic-
ing it. This is the ground floor, then, of observability (and, as such, bears a deep relation-
ship to Penrose's \u201Cspin networks: a topic for another time). What is more, it holds true
for all Box-Kites, in all 2N-ions. This is the Trip-Sync property. Proving it is easy.
        Let's write any S index using uppercase, and any o in lowercase; let's further write
\u201Csg\u201D to designate a binary variable equal to +1. Then any Assessors (K, k) and (L, l), if
joined by an edge-sign marked \u201C\u2013\u201D, will have product (K + sg\u00B7k) \u00B7 (L \u2013 sg\u00B7l) = (KL \u2013 sg\u00B7Kl
+ sg\u00B7kL \u2013 kl) = 0. Since KL and kl = o's, and Kl and kL = S's, then KL = kl = m, and Kl =
kL = M, where (M, m) is the third Assessor in the Sail. If the edge-sign be \u201C+,\u201D then the
opposite obtains: KL = \u2013kl = \u2013m, so S-trip (K, L, m) has opposite sense from O-trip (k,
l, m). Since the edge-signs leading out from a Zigzag vertex in a Trefoil must be \u201C+,\u201D the
edge opposite said vertex in the Trefoil will be marked \u201C\u2013\u201D; hence only the lone S-trip in
this Trefoil which includes a Zigzag o will \u201Clet things slide.\u201D (QED \u2013 no kidding!)

\u000C        This may not seem like such a big deal: at least, not within the Sedenions. But as
early as the 32-D Pathions, larger ensembles present themselves \u2013 seven Box-Kite septets
I call \u201CPl\u00E9iades\u201D emerge, which interconnect 14 Assessors, each of which belongs to 3
Box-Kites and 6 Sails. Sharing these properties but not others is the \u201Cmiddleman\u201D be-
tween them and the \u201CSand Mandalas,\u201D which I call the \u201CMuster Master.\u201D Each of its 7
Box-Kite Zigzags is exclusively mapped to an O-trip \u2013 which means, if we treat \u201Cspin-
flips\u201D as units of attractive or repulsive force, the Muster Master can round up (or chase
off) any and all Sedenion Box-Kites by an extension of Trip-Sync slippage.
        Given its unique holding capacity (harboring 1 copy each of every O- and S-trip
appearing in any Sedenion Box-Kite), the Muster Master effectively serves, then, as a
Pathion \u201CAtlas\u201D for all ZD patterns on the other side of the 24-ion/25-ion divide. Given,
further, that the word derives from the name of the Titan in Greek myth who kept the
earth and heavens separated by brute strength \u2013 and who also fathered the seven sisters
called the \u201CPl\u00E9iades\u201D \u2013 we could even say \u201CAtlas\u201D is the \u201CMuster Master\u201D's proper name!
        If we assume, as well, that Box-Kites are free-floating, each with its own copy of
(or window on) Zero, and its own clones of appropriate 2N-ion units acting as \u201Cinternal
coordinates,\u201D wild \u201Cpopulation dynamics,\u201D with all sorts of \u201Cclumpings\u201D and \u201Cschisms\u201D in
evidence, suggest themselves. Further, given the simplicity of the latticework connecting
Assessors and their composites, and the binary nature of the \u201Cspin control\u201D we can put in
play among them, the simplest approach to their study seems to mandate NKS setups.
The final pages will provide broad and sharp-edged guidelines for pursuing them.
        The remainder of this presentation will be focused on three tasks. First, if we
must (rather literally) \u201Credouble\u201D our efforts by moving from Sedenions to higher reaches
(to the 32-D Pathions at least, where \u201CSand Mandalas,\u201D \u201CPl\u00E9iades,\u201D and the \u201CMuster Mas-
ter\u201D live), we'll need to redeem an earlier promissory note, and provide some \u201Cpseudo-
code\u201D-level detail concerning general 2N-ion multiplication. Next, we'll probe the pheno-
mena just alluded to in 32-D, wherein NKS patterns respectively were first suspected, and
NKS tactics seem most clearly motivated. Then we'll hone in on a surprisingly deep con-
nection between ZD's and Boolean logic, which I'm only beginning to grasp myself \u2013
which will lead me to rough-sketch a promising possibility for fusion of methods.
        At April's conference, my own poster was situated a few feet away from Rodrigo
Obando's in the presentation gallery, and what I gathered of his work from discussions
there and later surprised and excited me. Certain \u201Cmagic numbers\u201D were common to both
our approaches, for reasons neither of us clearly understands yet. The order of the second
\u201Csimple group,\u201D 168, plays a critical role in his Boolean-function approach toward gener-
ating (r = 2) NKS complexity from logical \u201Cfirst principles\u201D (it's the number of both iso-
and anti- tone functions with 4 variables, a result which goes all the way back to Dede-
kind). In my own eliciting of ZD \u201Chead counts,\u201D 42 Assessors implies168 oriented lines
of ZD's, as well as the same number of \u201Cedge currents\u201D (2 per edge, 12 edges per Box-
Kite), both echoing the order of PSL(2,7), the finite projective triangle which houses
Octonion labeling schemes \u2013 and pops up again when investigating fixed \u201Cstrut-constant\u201D
slices of the Pathion pie . . . about which, I can't say anything further until I've deployed
the arguments just promised. But I can say that such surprising \u201Chybrid fusion,\u201D between
such disparate points of view, is what conferences like NKS 2004 are meant to facilitate.
What better theme, then, could present itself for bringing these pages to a close?

R. de Marrais                              Page 9               \u201CSomething From Nothing\u201D
\u000C3: Revisiting the CDP Algorithm; Invading the 32-D of the Pathions
         Let's return to the scene of the crime: the triplet listings on page 5. Recall that the
first of the 4 columns of S-trips has all its length-3 lists in counting and signing order (be-
cause the '8' in the middle is the generator). What to make of the apparently random way
disordered lists display in the columns to the right? Reading from the left, there are 4, 5,
and 3 in successive columns: half the 28 \u201C8-less\u201D O- and S- trips. Where is the pattern in
this? The answer is found in the relation of the rows (one per o) to the 3 O-trips implicit,
via \u201Cslippage,\u201D in the o-harboring S-trips listed across each row's \u201C8-less\u201D columns.
         If you left-multiply i8 by any io, you get + i(8+o) \u2013 which is an S. Likewise, multi-
plying i8 on the left by any S will yield a negative o \u2013 of index (S \u2013 8). Apply this obvious
logic to the triplets on the left, operating on those in the rows whose leading o's form an
O-trip. In the cycle (1, 2, 3), two consecutive terms have xor equal to the third, with pos-
itive sign; the rightmost terms in the same rows, though, while not forming a cycle as
written, imply one upon xoring and sign-flipping. Paralleling 2 xor 3 = 1, we have 10 xor
11 = 1, but with sign reversed. Whence the S-trip at the top of the 1st column, (1, 11, 10).
By cycling according to the same logic, (3 xor 1 = 11 xor 9 = 2) \u2192 (2, 9, 11), and (1 xor 2
= 9 xor 10 = 3) \u2192 (3, 10, 9). By proceeding similarly with (1, 4, 5), rows 1 of the 2nd
column, and rows 4 and 5 of the 1st, get filled in, while working with (1, 7, 6) completes
the 1st row and 1st column. Conducting the same sort of business with the next two O-
trips \u2013 (2, 4, 6) and (2, 5, 7) \u2013 suffices to finish the tabulation.
         This procedure can be extended to 2N-ions, N any integer: just replace 8 with the
appropriate generator, g = 2N-1, and create a first column with g \u2013 1 triplets, one per row.
The number of columns will correspond to the number of L- (no longer just O-) trips,
where L indicates indices lower than g (with U indicating those we'd now signify with
uppercase lettering, the way we used S for Sedenion indices > 8, which indices appear in
U-trips). For the Pathions, this means 7 columns to the right \u2013 the number of Octonion
units. For 2N-ions generally, the number of columns to the right of the g-containing one
equals the count of imaginary units in the 2N-2-ions: 0 for H, 1 for O; 3 for S; 7 for P...
         This table-building strategy is not only easy to implement, but it's a lot simpler
than the way the CDP algorithm is typically explained \u2013 which means, perhaps, it should
be dubbed the \u201CFast CDP.\u201D And it also suggests a table-free method for calculating the
products of any two imaginaries of arbitrary indices. It can be summarized in 3 rules:
         Triple Negatives Rule: For the general product of two units whose indices are r
and c (for row and column, where we read off the left- and right-hand terms to the multi-
plication in an imagined table of product indices, ranging from 0 to 2N+1 - 1), if both are
less than the generator g = 2N, the value in cell (r, c) of the table = r\u00B7c. If one term > g (it
doesn't matter which), the index and sign of their product is just [\u2013(2N + r\u00B7c)]. If both
terms > g, XOR-ing kills the 2N, leaving just [\u2013r\u00B7c].
         Trident Rule: Multiplying g on the left (right) by any unit whose index > g re-
sults in a unit whose index is their sum, with same (opposite) sign. Diagonal entries in
quadrants of the table (the result of products where r = c) are + g below the main diagonal
(whose \u201Cindex 0\u201D entries, all squares of imaginaries, evaluate to \u20131), and \u2013 g above it (but
for the 1st row, which is just the trivial, all-positive, products with the real unit).
         Recursive Bottoming: Successive use of these two rules resolves all products.

R. de Marrais                              Page 10                \u201CSomething From Nothing\u201D
\u000C         The reader is encouraged to pore over the Sedenion multiplication table, the better
to see how it conforms to these rules, taking g variously as 1, 2 or 3. A version with
checkerboard shading, to make two levels of \u201Cquadrants\u201D easier to see, can be reached by
clicking the \u201CBK1\u201D URL in the 3rd endnote and going to page 6. As a way to gain rapid
entry into higher dimensions, however, the reader is invited to consider another rule,
which can generate properly signed triplets in arbitrarily high dimension.
         Zero-Stuffing: Insert 0's in the same position in the binary representation of a
triplet, and you'll get another, similarly signed. Taking the H-spanning triplet (1, 2, 3)
and stuffing 0's to the right, then the middle, yields the O-trips (2, 4, 6) and (1, 4, 5). This
plus the sign-flipping effect of adding 1-bits to the left of, then xoring, doublets \u2013 (1, 2);
(2, 3); (3, 1) giving (3, 6, 5); (1, 7, 6); (2, 5, 7) \u2013 yields up all the O-trips save (3, 4, 7).
         Zero-stuffing can generate an infinite series of \u201Charmonics\u201D of any given triplet;
and, by extension, it can give us a similarly infinite \u201Covertone series\u201D of Box-Kites. This
fact, plus a simple generalization of the \u201Cstrut constant\u201D notion, makes generating and
classifying Box-Kites in the Pathions fairly straightforward (up to a point, as I'll shortly
spell out). Take the four O-trips of one of the seven Sedenion Box-Kites, and make them
the L-trips for a \u201Cbase-line\u201D Pathion Box-Kite by stuffing a zero to the right of the left-
most 1-bit in each Assessor's S term: the strut constant remains unchanged, but the S
terms become U terms, with indices increased by 8.
         In the Sedenions, though, each strut constant, by dint of being a \u201Cmissing Octon-
ion,\u201D implicated 3 pairs of strut-opposite Assessors (one per each O-trip containing it).
But 7 S-trips contain the Octonion, and each of these must be accommodated when we set
about constructing Box-Kites in the Pathions. The upshot is that each strut constant now
collects 7 Box-Kites, as there are now 24-2 Assessors to choose from: each of these will
zero-divide all but itself and its strut-opposite, for 168 ZD products \u2013 and, as the 4 Sails
of a Box-Kite each mandate 6 such products, we get 168 / 24 = 7 Box-Kites in all.
         Consider the 4 Pathion L-trips which are S-trips, associated with strut constant s =
1: (1, 8, 9); (1, 11, 10); (1, 13, 12); (1, 14, 15). We get 8 Assessors out of them by first
throwing away the 1's, then taking one of the remaining terms as given, and adding a 1-bit
to the left of the other: (8, 25) and (9, 24) form a pair of strut-opposites, as do (11, 26)
and (10, 27); (13, 28) and (12, 29); and (14, 31) and (15, 30). We then build Zigzags by
keeping one O-strut, moving it into the A, F slots if not there to start with, and picking
two S-trip Assessors among the four pair just listed which form L-trips at (A, B, C) and
(A, D, E). Zero-stuffing and 1-bit appending make picking and arranging fairly easy.
         For instance, keeping with the ongoing example, the L-terms at the vertices for the
base-line Box-Kite with s = 1 are (3, 6, 5, 4, 7, 2). Keep 3 and 2 at A and F: appending
8's to the left of the (B, C), then (D, E), terms reverses their order, giving us this new
Box-Kite: (3, 13, 14, 15, 12, 2). Stuffing zeros to the left of the 21 bit, meanwhile, keeps
terms in their places, but changes the L-terms at the vertices to read this way: (3, 10, 9, 8,
11, 3). Rotating the (B, E) and (C, D) L-pairs to (A, F) scrambles the ordering a bit, but
the same basic principle applies: with (6, 5) at (A, F), the \u201CL-bit trick\u201D gives us (after
some rearrange) this list: (6, 11, 13, 12, 10, 7); the second Box-Kite with (6, 5) on the A-
F strut, though, requires both tricks to isolate an appropriate match with the right S-trip
Assessors: zero-stuffing sends (5, 4) to (9, 8); but applying the \u201CL-bit trick\u201D twice is
required to send (3, 2) to (15, 14), the last available S-trip Assessors.

\u000C         This last example suggests a problem: with the Sedenions, s ranges from 1 to 7 \u2013
this last being one less than the generator, g. For the Pathions, g = 16, so there are 15
values possible for s. But one of these = the Sedenions' g (which we might call the Path-
ions' \u201Csubgenerator,\u201D g-1), and 7 exceed it. If multiple \u201CL-bit trick\u201D applications are need-
ed frequently, might we not risk \u201Ccarry-bit overflow\u201D as s grows? The answer is yes.
         The reference four paragraphs back to a 14 x 14 multiplication table is not quite
exact, since the product of mutual ZD's, strictly speaking, is zero by definition. To be
informative, the table's cells show emanations: per the earlier definition, diagonals of
Assessors which mutually act as ZD's in fact engage in \u201Cpair production\u201D of two opposite-
ly signed copies of the third Assessor in their Sail. The L-term index for this third Asses-
sor is what's shown in the \u201Cemanation table,\u201D with an underbar if the edge-sign joining its
producing Assessors (whose L-term indices are shown on the row and column headings)
is \u201C\u2013\u201D. Such a table has blank diagonals (since Assessors never make ZD's between their
own diagonals, or with those of their strut-opposite), hence 142 \u2013 2\u00B714 = 168 filled-in
cells. When s = g-1, though, the edge-signs cluster so that all cells in the upper left and
lower right quadrants are \u201C\u2013\u201D, while those in the opposite quadrants are all \u201C+\u201D.
         When s > g-1, however, the ZD population suddenly collapses: only 72 cells are
filled in in each, meaning 3, not 7, Box-Kites. Consider the first such case (s = 9):

                                  A      B       C       D      E        F
Base-Line Box-Kite:            (2, 27) (8, 17) (10,19) (3, 26)(1, 24) (11, 18)
\u201CFirst Harmonic\u201D:              (4, 29) (8, 17) (12,21) (5, 28)(1, 24) (13, 20)
\u201CSecond Harmonic\u201D:             (7, 30) (8, 17) (15,22) (6, 31)(1, 24) (14, 23)

        It is tempting to assume the 6 Assessors arrayed in the columns D and A, after
minor rearrangement, form another in the \u201Covertone series\u201D of our s = 1 \u201Cbaseline Box-
Kite\u201D: but \u201Ccarrybit overflow\u201D is at work, so that left-appending 1-bits to all U-terms \u2013
converting (3, 10) into (3, 10+16 = 26) and so on, thereby reversing signs on all 3 mem-
bers (an odd number) of each triplet \u2013 suffices, in this case, to kill off all the ZD's we'd
expect to see. Just as surprising, the triplet (1, 8, 9), \u201Csterile\u201D in the Sedenion context,
provides the doublet from which the Assessors that triply repeat at B and E are fabricated.
        A mystery, finally, is placed before us when the 7 (s > g-1 ) tables, collectively
dubbed \u201CSand Mandalas\u201D after the Tibetan meditative drawings they resemble, are view-
ed in \u201Cflip-book\u201D style: while the (o, 8, o+s) repeaters cluster inside the array, all other
emanations are confined to the perimeter, with this square's edges pulling back in unison
from the table's boundaries by one cell with each increment to s (while the \u201Crepeaters\u201D
reconfigure), until we're left in the last still-shot with a 2-cell-thick cross whose ends are
joined up by the \u201Crepeaters\u201D \u2013 which have rearranged themselves into diagonals.
        It was this behavior (whose necessity was proven, after the fact of stumbling on it,
explicitly via elaborate bit-twiddling in \u201CBK2\u201D on p. 16) which first suggested something
like cellular automata at work. More peculiar still, if one folds the table over like a hand-
kerchief, along both horizontal and vertical midlines, the L-terms in the \u201Cshrinking box\u201D
coalesce to form the O- and S- terms of the 6 Assessors in the Sedenion Box-Kites whose
strut constants = the differences of the table's s and g-1 terms ( i.e., 1 - 7); the \u201Crepeaters,\u201D
meanwhile, coalesce to form the \u201Cforbidden doublet\u201D of the Sedenion Box-Kite's s and g!

         The above graphics are reproduced from p. 15 of \u201CBK2,\u201D and should be read from
left to right, top to bottom: the first \u201Cemanation table\u201D is for s = 8; the last, for s = 15.
Rows, columns, and cell contents show L-index numbers of the associated Assessors in
hex (since values range from 1 to 15). Rows and columns are further arranged so that
strut-opposites appear in \u201Cnested parentheses\u201D format, in otherwise ascending order, as
with the earlier Sedenion strut table. Since diagonals will always be empty of emanations,
they are simply left blank; in all but the first table, the majority of non-diagonal cells are
also unfilled, and these are left empty, but with light gray background. Cells which form
into the 3 Box-Kites' (o, 8, 8+o) \u201Crepeaters\u201D are daubed green; the others are painted red.
         As one might expect, as the N in 2N-ion increases, \u201Ccarry-bit overflow\u201D becomes
even more pronounced, with patterns that look progressively more \u201Cfractal\u201D than those
shown: at high s, as cells become more numerous, boundaries become crenelated, and
box-kites even break up into pieces. It is unclear what happens for very large N: does the
density of ZD's \u2192 0 as N \u2192 \u221E? Would that imply (and quite counterintuitively) that
high-s , high-N spaces become \u201Ctame,\u201D perhaps with something like a Hilbert space as a
limit; or, do they instead \u201Cmerely\u201D become unwieldy and chaotic? Abolutely nothing is
know at present \u2013 including whether or not these are good questions!
         The heading for the graphics indicates that the \u201CMuster Master\u201D is also on display.
Clearly, it's the upper leftmost, s = 8, table: ironically, the same index plagued with ZD-
sterility when it's the generator becomes the most \u201Comnivoyant\u201D of all configurations
when it is \u201Cdemoted\u201D to subgenerator status in the next round of CDP expansionism. Pre-
cisely because it's excluded, all the Octonions are included among the L-trips \u2013 leading to
7 Box-Kites each of whose Zigzag has an O-trip for lower indices . . . meaning \u201Cslippage\u201D
between U-trips and O-trips could be effected \u201Cionically\u201D or \u201Ccovalently\u201D between the
Muster Master and any Sedenion Box-Kite, and in an\u201Cunobservable\u201D manner, thanks to
Zigzag involvement. But Sedenion S-trips can be Pathion L-trips, so \u201Cbonding\u201D is subtle.


R. de Marrais                             Page 13               \u201CSomething From Nothing\u201D
\u000C        We could, in fact, describe the situation, using the argot of object-oriented pro-
gramming, as perfect \u201Cdesign-hiding\u201D: for while the o's in the ABC positions (and hence,
the Zigzag) of each Sedenion Box-Kite exactly match the Zigzag L-trip of exactly one of
the 7 component Box-Kites of the Muster Master, it is the S's in the former's DEF posi-
tions which get promoted to L-trip status in the latter. Hence, Trefoil L-trips \u201Cresonate\u201D
with the U-trips of the lower-order Box-Kites \u2013 but only with those that share their sing-
leton o with the Zigzag! The Muster Master Box-Kite which shares Zigzag L-trips with a
given Sedenion Box-Kite cannot have its actions observed at all from the latter's purview.
        This is not the whole story, though: in Sedenion Box-Kite IV, for instance, the S-
trip (13, 11, 6) \u2013 which we'll write (A, D, e) to obey our casing convention \u2013 \u201Cresonates\u201D
with (f, d, b) of the Muster Master's Zigzag-match to Sedenion Box-Kite I, and this inter-
action is a Trip-Sync \u201Cobservable.\u201D Below is a synthesis of data from the \u201CSynchroniza-
tion Table By Box-Kite and Sail\u201D on the penultimate page of \u201CBK3,\u201D and the component
Box-Kites of the Muster Master, listed by their Sedenion Zigzag-matches' strut constants
(shorthanded \u201CZM#\u201D in the table). Note that vertex locations are rotated ( \u00AE ) in 4 of the
7 Muster Master components: this affects labeling (e.g., Trefoils might switch places and
their cyclings shift in phase), but not triplet orientation, and so can be ignored.

\u000C       Before analyzing the results of the table above, some backgrounding concerning
the Muster Master is in order, the better to make the results we'll be discussing seem all
the sharper. For completeness' sake, here's a listing of the full set of the Muster Master's
14 Assessors, showing both L- and U- indices, with strut-pairs arrayed vertically:

       (1, 25)   ( 2, 26)    ( 3, 27)   ( 4, 28)    ( 5, 29)   ( 6, 30)    ( 7, 31)
       (9, 17)   (10, 18)    (11, 19)   (12, 20)    (13, 21)   (14, 22)    (15, 23)

        The utter simplicity of this deployment belies the complexities implied in the
table. It would greatly aid intuition to have some way to picture the synergy between the
7 component Box-Kites of this highly symmetric \u201Cfather\u201D to the Pathion \u201CPl\u00E9iades,\u201D
whose 7 \u201Cnymph\u201D Assessors with o's for L-terms nicely echo the 7 \u201Cstars\u201D with L-term S's
who form their strut-partners. The two descriptive pieces of this last sentence each will
lead us to investigate a different graphical depiction. Let's begin, first of all, with a way
to envision 14 Assessors, each in 3 of the 7 \u201Ccleanly partitioned\u201D Box-Kites (by which I
mean, no edges are shared between them), appearing thereby in twice 3 = 6 Sails. The
following is lifted from a paper describing \u201Coctahedral fractal\u201D models12 \u2013 a topic which
has no direct bearing here, although the graphic fits our themes perfectly.
        We can scan this as 7 stacks of 3 Box-Kites\u2013 3 trios including the central one, and
4 more joined by the dashed lines. Assume stacking suggestive of a voltaic pile for the
centrally coordinated sets: if the Assessor at the top of the vertical stack, for instance, is
\u201CA,\u201D it would be replaced in its position in the next-lower Box-Kite by its strut-opposite,
\u201CF,\u201D so that the sequence of descending labels for the trio would be this: A, F=F, A=A, F;
similarly for the perpendicular lines of Box-Kites in the central horizontal plane. For the
other 4 trios, assume vertices joined by dotted lines from the central squares are strut-op-
posites as well. There's a lot of rotating and translating you have to deal with to make a
                                          consistent labeling scheme; putting in indices, too,
                                putt p would induce a truly noxious degree of cluttering,
                                          so I won't even try. The idea, I hope, will suffice!
                                                  While this graphic, then, serves to present
                                          an image of the interconnectedness of Assessors
                                          in the Pl\u00E9iades scheme, it gives no clear feeling
                                          for Assessor-level detail: a way to picture the
                                          indices without the distraction of 3-D would be
                                          a useful thing. Here, we can adapt the tactic,
                                          mentioned in passing at the end of the last section,
                                          of representing triplets as intersecting lines, via
                                          finite projective groups: a \u201Cstereo\u201D version of
                                          of the PSL(2,7) layout of labeling schemes for
                                          the Octonions which was championed by the late
                                          great Canadian geometer Harry Coxeter. The
                                          interrelations among indices for Atlas and his
                                          Pl\u00E9iades can be cleanly displayed in this manner,
                                          and \u201Cloop algebra\u201D subtleties framed naturally, in
                                          their turn, by referencing these diagram-pairings.

R. de Marrais                             Page 15               \u201CSomething From Nothing\u201D
\u000C                                      PSL(2,7) expresses the symmetries of the simplest non-
                                  trivial finite projective plane, known by Fano's name. In
                                  projective geometry, lines and circles are equivalent, so
                                  this diagram should be interpreted as comprising 7 lines,
                                  including the apparent \u201Ccircle\u201D in the middle. The lines
                                  intersect in 7 points, the Octonion units: the cross-overs
                                  with no nodes or labels are illusions of the projection
                                  process. In this elegant rendering (from Ref. 1, p. 46),
                                  Quaternion units are in lower case (the standard \u201Ci,j,k\u201D)
                                  and make the central cycle. The (index-4) generator is at
their circle's center, E. The triangle's vertices are just the products of their lower-case
equivalents with E, so that lines through E are oriented from lower to upper case letters.
Similarly, all three edges on the perimeter flow clockwise, while the central \u201Ci,j,k\u201D flows
likewise. The symmetry group of this 2-D configuration of 7 lines, each being intersected
by 3 others (or equivalently, thanks to projective duality, 7 points, where each \u201Ccycle\u201D is
determined by 3 of them) is just 7 x 3 x 23 (the number of possible signing conventions
per triplet), or 168. But this is precisely the total symmetry of \u201CBox-Kite space\u201D as well,
since we have 7 of them, each with 4 3-cycles or \u201CSails\u201D(which means they obey the 24-
element rotational symmetry of their Octahedral container). If you have stereo glasses
available, you can \u201Csee\u201D this from Buckland Polster's Fano Plane graphic from The Ma-
thematical Intelligencer 21 (1999) 38-43: here, the 7 \u201Clines\u201D are just the 3 Struts and 4
Sails, with the 7 \u201Cpoints\u201D being the vertices plus the Zero (which we assume is \u201Cpiped in\u201D
to the centers of each Assessor-plane \u201Cscreen\u201D by Strut-connected \u201Ccable TV\u201D!)




        What I have in mind here is another sort of \u201Cstereo,\u201D with the 14 Assessors in any
given Pl\u00E9iade being partitioned across two such layouts. Just as the PSL(2,7) triangle
above can have its letters removed and relabeled by myriad different indexing schemes,
with the arrows also having their orientations switched accordingly, so too with our
\u201Cstereo Fano\u201D manner of showing Pl\u00E9iade symmetries. In the little table at the top of the
next page, I'll just give the index-number equivalents for the letters, and assume you can
figure out the O- trip and S-trip orientations without my help at this point.

        For all but \u201CAtlas,\u201D the 7 L-trips in each line of the lefthand listing split up so that
4 of the component Box-Kites are represented by their Zigzags, and 3 (all and only those
containing an \u201C8,\u201D always situated at \u201CD\u201D) by their ADE Trefoils. This is the Pathions'
equivalent of the \u201CStrut Table\u201D provided for Sedenions. The fact that a fully functional
copy of PSL(2,7) can uniquely serve to integrate all a Pl\u00E9iade's Box-Kites (with its \u201Csha-
dow\u201D on the right providing \u201Cstereo vision\u201D by housing, vertex by vertex, the lefthand
terms' strut opposites) gives striking proof of the Pleiades' fundamental synergies as en-
sembles: they are by no means loose affilations of independent entities, \u201Ccat-herded\u201D op-
portunistically. (Exercise: draw all 7 Kites for each line, properly orienting the edges!)
        Now it is time to turn our attention, at last, to the \u201CTrip-Sync Observables Table\u201D
on Page 14. The first thing to stress is that there is an exact, one-to-one correspondence
between Sails on the Sedenion \u201Creceiving end\u201D and the Pathion \u201Csending end\u201D of any
transactions between them: tautologically, each ZM# indicates a Zigzag-to-Zigzag
matchup of the \u201Cunobservable\u201D kind; but there is also precisely one \u201Cunobservable\u201D link-
up, from each Muster Master component's Trefoil Sail L-trip, to some specific S-trip in
some Sedenion Zigzag. And there are also precisely two \u201Cobservable\u201D connections from
Trefoil-based Muster Master L-trips to specific Sedenion Trefoil S-trips. Such extreme
orderliness and specialization of connection indicates we're dealing with a very stable,
well-articulated platform for doing something.
        But doing what, exactly? Here is where I see the next line of research, which will,
I hope, be ripe for presenting at NKS 2005. Viewed in full generality, we have this for a
setup: a latticework of connected Assessors, where Sedenion Box-Kites can \u201Cchannel\u201D a
quartet of independent inputs from the Pathions' \u201Chigher plane\u201D; these inputs are effect-
ively binary, and there is one output, also binary. We have also seen, from many angles
now, the critical role of 168-fold symmetry in all these workings. It is at this point that
Rodrigo Obando's ongoing work13 on applying Boolean function theory to NKS systems
shouts for our attention: for there are 168 4-variable monotone functions, and the same
number of complements, which he first indicated at NKS 2003 can provide the key to
determining the classification of NKS behaviors displayed by arbitrary rules. His basic
tactic (and its clear \u201Cresonance\u201D with ZD setups) goes like this.

R. de Marrais                              Page 17                \u201CSomething From Nothing\u201D
\u000C         Split the bit representation of a rule into two \u201Cprimitives.\u201D One string contains bits
indicative of an initial input combination that has the central cell's value = 0. The other
contains those telling what happens if said cell value = 1. For the (r=2) situation that
clearly obtains with the Trip-Sync linkup of Pathions to Sedenions, the possible rules
equal 2 raised to the (25 = ) 32nd power, which is more than 4 billion rules altogether \u2013
an awful lot to have to wade through if we've no initial notion of which ones are Class 1
(boringly homogenous outcomes), which are Class 2 (evolving into simply separated peri-
odic structures), which yield up chaotic aperiodic patterns (Class 3), and which \u2013 the real
\u201Cmoney shot\u201D here \u2013 generate truly complex \u201CClass 4\u201D patterns of localized structures.
         But Obando's work strongly suggests (with some specific examples to buttress his
claims) that we can, indeed, predict what sort of behavior a rule will display, and even say
which will be Class 4. First, partition a rule into \u201Cprimitives,\u201D then see if their bit repre-
sentations are Boolean monotones. Because the \u201Cprimitives\u201D have half the string each,
this means we're dealing with the much more manageable count of 216 logical express-
ions, or 65,536 possibilities, that each \u201Chalf-rule\u201D can display. If the primitives are pro-
perly chosen from the two \u201Cmonotonous\u201D sets of 168 \u2013 each created recursively, by bit-
string and-ing and or-ing, out of Oneness and Nothing \u2013 we'll get Class 4 complexity.
         But meanwhile, we have two sets of 168 ZD \u201Cprimitives,\u201D on opposite sides of the
Sedenion/Pathion \u201Cinfobarrier\u201D: one, then, from each party to our \u201Cchanneling.\u201D And
each Box-Kite \u201Cedge current,\u201D if encoded as a string of 0's and 1's, can be uniquely speci-
fied by precisely 16 bits. Consider it this way (and there are other ways as well): any
\u201Csuccessful\u201D ZD product entails the involvement of 2 Assessors, which for the Sedenion
\u201Ctarget\u201D (and isomorphically for Pathion \u201Cbroadcaster\u201D) means 4 bits for each S index, 3
for each o, and 2 extra bits \u201Cleft over.\u201D Suppose we say these latter determine the diago-
nals \u2013 \u201C\\ or /?\u201D \u2013 as specified at the two ends of the connecting edge. (N.B.: the edge
sign's value itself is not an independent variable, so can't be counted!)
         Now we need to tweak this (or is it \u201Ckludge things up\u201D?) a bit. The problem is,
stating just this much means we get two distinct strings for each \u201Cedge-current,\u201D depend-
ing upon which Assessor we write out first. But rather than get worked up about this
double-count of strings, let's make use of this implicit positional information, in this way:
if the first Assessor is \u201Cless than\u201D the second (the o index is lower, say, or it has an earlier
birthday: it doesn't matter how, just that it's \u201Cless than\u201D), then assume they both employ
the \u201C/ \u201D diagonal. If the first written down is the greater, however, assume \u201C \\ \u201D. Next,
use the first of our leftovers for a \u201Cswitch bit\u201D in this sense: if \u201C0,\u201D do nothing; if \u201C1,\u201D
switch the diagonal used by the second in sequence, not size. Which leaves us with one
last \u201Cextra\u201D to interpret: I call this bit the \u201Cspigot,\u201D since I envision it as turning the
\u201Cedge-current\u201D on or off \u2013 something I have trouble imagining not playing a role!
         And while the \u201C168\u201D in the ZD universe are most definitely not Boolean mono-
tone functions by any stretch of the imagination \u2013 their fundamental workings, after all,
are defined by XORing, which is not an allowable operation in monotone string-building
\u2013 there most definitely is very good reason to expect a rich harvest of transformations
between the two mathematical languages. Let me put this another way: even though I
don't carry an AARP card yet, I still can remember when the idea of \u201CChaotic number
theory\u201D would have seemed too insane to bear contemplating; by the next NKS confer-
ence, I hope to make the case that the problem with that notion is, it's just too tame.

   understood in Soviet-era Moscow) to the whole theme of hypercomplex numbers, all building up to the formulation, in
   Chapter 17, of Hurwitz's 1896 proof that \u201CEvery normed algebra with an identity is isomorphic to one of following four
   algebras: the real numbers, the complex numbers, the quaternions, and the Cayley numbers.\u201D

   obey a structure homomorphic to the Lie algebra indicated by the Dynkin Diagram \u201CG2\u201D; but homo- is not iso- morphic,
   and only a single concrete instance of a pair of ZD's was given . . . which led to my own radically constructivist, almost

   workings of the entirety of 16-D ZD's. (Moreno notes, too, that \u201CG2\u201D also implies a powerful scaling of results into

   nonassociative structures rather easily in higher-dimensional contexts; he in fact found an equivalent manner of express-
   ing my tabulations from BK1 in \u201Cloop language,\u201D which he presented in a paper of this year to the National Research
   Council of the Philippines, \u201COn the Structure and Zero Divisors of the Sedenion Algebra\u201D; the correspondence which
   ensued after he communicated this to me proved delightfully engaging, and was the direct trigger for \u201CBK3.\u201D
5 Trickier \u201Csquares rules,\u201D though, abound, as do esoteric algebras concerned with them, such as \u201CPfister forms\u201D; A. R.
   Rajwade, in fact, has devoted a whole book to them: Squares (Cambridge U. P.: Cambridge UK, 1993). Using his
   convenient shorthand, the standard rules have form (2n, 2n, 2n) where n < 4; for 16-D, though, two 16-D numbers, com-
   prising 16 squares each, generally have a product representable by 32 squares (16, 16, 32). But stranger results are also
   possible: (9, 16, 16) and (10, 10, 16) also work \u2013 which may \u201Cmean something very significant\u201D as far as Sedenions are
   concerned (except, whatever it is, no one's discovered it is yet!).

   misuse of an analogy by pressing it to the point at which it is confused with an identity, is one to which biological
   thought is peculiarly liable.\u201D Where Ms. Arber says \u201Cbiological,\u201D though, we can just as well speak of any heavily

   Kite (and 1 per Sail). These refer to the 7 \u201Cdeformed\u201D Octonion copies the Sedenions contain, which I variously called
   \u201CMoreno counterfeits\u201D and \u201Cautomorphemes\u201D (the latter being a name only someone overly fond of L\u00E9vi-Strauss's struc-
   turalism could love). It was these which, by other means, Cawagas showed corresponded to instances of a hitherto unre-
   cognized variety of ZD-harboring \u201Cloop.\u201D Each of these 7 loops contains 4 \u201CCo-Assessor trio\u201D 6-cycles, each of which
