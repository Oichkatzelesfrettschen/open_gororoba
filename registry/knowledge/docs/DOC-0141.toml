## Key Contributions

### 1. Spandrels (Hidden Box-Kites)

*Spandrels* are quartets of ZD-free or \"hidden\" box-kite-like structures
(HBKs) in the 2^{N+1}-ions that are \"exploded\" from (and uniquely linked to)
each standard box-kite in the 2^N-ions, for N >= 4.

Any HBK houses, in a \"cowbird's nest,\" exactly one copy of the (ZD-free)
octonions -- the recursive basis for all ZD ensembles.

### 2. Three Production Rules (Formalized)

**Production Rule 1 (Emanation):** If diagonals at assessors A and B mutually
zero-divide, each also does so with a diagonal of C (oppositely signed copies
of whose unit pairings embody the zero produced). A and B *emanate* C.
L-indices (a, b, c) form a trip iff their assessors' diagonals each mutually
zero-divide one of those at each of the other two.

A *sail* is a triad of assessors forming such a trip. There is exactly one sail
per box-kite with all three edges marked \"-\": the *zigzag* (A, B, C). Its
6-cycle of zero-divisions shows alternating / and \\ slopings.

**Production Rule 2 (Catamaran twist):** L- (or U-) indices can be swapped
(with a sign flip) between assessors sharing an edge, yielding assessor pairs
in other box-kites with different strut constants. Opposite edges of the same
square (one of 3 mutually orthogonal ones) twist to the same box-kite and
have the same sign type.

**Production Rule 3 (Assessor membership):** Any assessor belongs to exactly
2 sails, like same-color checkerboard squares touching only at vertices. The
pair of imaginary units forming any assessor always splits so that one has
index less than G (L-unit) and one greater than G (U-unit).

### 3. Catamaran Twist Structure

Box-kites have three mutually orthogonal \"squares\" (catamarans) formed by
strut pairs. Each catamaran has 4 edges connecting its 4 assessors. Opposite
edges twist to the same other box-kite and share edge-sign type.

### 4. G_2 Homomorphism

The automorphism group of the ZDs in 2^N-ions (for N >= 4) is
G_2 x (N-3) x S3, where G_2 is the smallest exceptional Lie group (the
Octonion automorphism group). The order for sedenions: 14 x 1 x 6 = 84
(the count of ZD-saturated lines across all 7 box-kites).

### 5. Trip Count and ZD Census

| Dim  | Name     | Trips | Notes                                   |
|------|----------|-------|-----------------------------------------|
| 4    | H        | 1     | No ZDs                                  |
| 8    | O        | 7     | No ZDs (but associativity fails)        |
| 16   | S        | 35    | 84 ZD-lines in 7 box-kites             |
| 32   | P        | 155   | 588 ZD-lines, scale-free behavior       |
| 64   | X        | 651   | \"Fractality\" of ZD structure evident    |

### 6. Scale-Free Network Connection

The ZD web in higher 2^n-ions displays the \"scale-free\" property characteristic
of real-world networks (WWW, social, biological). This suggests using ZD
ensembles as enriched network-theory nodules for modeling semantic propagation.
