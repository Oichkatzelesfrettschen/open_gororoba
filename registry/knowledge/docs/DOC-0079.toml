# Box-Kite Structure

The 42 zero-divisor cross-assessors of the sedenion algebra organize into
7 **box-kites**, a combinatorial structure first described by Robert de Marrais
(arXiv: math/0011260, 2000).

## Structure

Each box-kite contains 6 assessors arranged as 3 \"strut\" pairs.  The assessor
interaction graph within each box-kite is the complete tripartite graph
K(2,2,2) -- an octahedron.

De Marrais published an explicit strut table in his 2000 paper.  Our
computational census matches this table exactly (C-454, verified against
the original via `test_strut_table_matches_de_marrais_flying_higher`).

## Emanation architecture

The box-kite structure extends to an 18-layer \"emanation\" construction
(L1-L18) also due to de Marrais.  Key properties verified:

- **DMZ** = sign-concordance (12 edges per box-kite)
- **Sail-loop** = Fano incidence pattern
- **Oriented Trip Sync** is universal across all 7 box-kites

Implementation: `crates/algebra_core/src/experimental/emanation.rs` (4400 lines, 113 tests).

See [Emanation Architecture](./emanation.md) for details.

## Beyond sedenions

At dimension 32 (pathions) and beyond, octahedra disappear entirely.  The
structure completely reorganizes into different component types.  See
[Motif Scaling Laws](./motif-scaling.md).

## Claims

C-050 through C-060: Box-kite invariants.
C-454: Strut table cross-validation.
C-468 through C-475: Emanation architecture.
