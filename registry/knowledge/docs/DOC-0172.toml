# Claims Methodology and Scientific Rigor

This document describes the claims discipline framework used to track, verify,
and disposition scientific claims throughout the project.

## 1. Claims Taxonomy

Every claim is assigned one of these canonical status tokens:

| Status | Definition | Action Required |
|--------|------------|-----------------|
| **Verified** | Reproducible computation or cited first-party source | None (closed) |
| **Refuted** | Contradicted by evidence or established constraints | None (closed) |
| **Modeled** | Implemented as toy model; may not be physically validated | Document limitations |
| **Closed/Toy** | Parameter coincidence, not derived from first principles | None (closed) |
| **Closed/Analogy** | Notational mapping only, not a derivation | None (closed) |
| **Established** | Standard background result; cite sources | None (closed) |
| **Clarified** | Corrected/renamed to avoid false statements | May need follow-up |
| **Speculative** | Conjecture awaiting data or derivation | Define falsification boundary |
| **Not supported** | In-repo checks found insufficient signal | Document negative result |
| **Partially verified** | Some evidence exists but gaps remain | Complete verification |
| **Theoretical** | Blueprint exists, device unbuilt/untested | Await experimental data |
| **Literature** | Literature claim not yet reproduced in-repo | Reproduce or cite |
| **Unverified** | No reliable evidence yet | Add sources + tests |

## 2. Verification Ladder

Claims progress through verification levels (Roy 2003 framework adapted):

### Level 0: Conjecture
- Stated informally in conversation or notes
- No code or data artifacts
- Action: Formalize as numbered claim (C-xxx)

### Level 1: Formalized
- Entered in CLAIMS_EVIDENCE_MATRIX.md
- Has \"What would verify/refute it\" column filled
- Action: Add primary sources and define test

### Level 2: Sourced
- Primary literature citations cached in `data/external/papers/`
- Sources indexed in `docs/external_sources/`
- Action: Implement validation test

### Level 3: Tested
- Unit test or verifier script exists
- Test is deterministic and offline
- Action: Run test, record result

### Level 4: Verified/Refuted
- Test passes (Verified) or fails decisively (Refuted)
- Result recorded with ISO date in matrix
- Action: None (closed)

## 3. Pre-Registration Protocol

For claims involving statistical tests on data:

1. **Define hypothesis** before looking at data
2. **Specify test statistic** and decision rule (e.g., p < 0.05)
3. **Document sample size** requirements (e.g., N >= 50)
4. **Record in** `docs/preregistered/CLAIM_NAME.md`
5. **Execute test** only after pre-registration
6. **Report result** including effect size and confidence interval

Example: GWTC-3 mass modality test (C-007) was pre-registered with N >= 50
requirement; test NOT executed because N=34 < 50 (validation correctly
prevented underpowered test).

## 4. Falsification Boundaries

Speculative claims MUST have explicit falsification boundaries:

```
Claim: C-008 neg-dim toy operator (alpha=-1.5, d_s=2)
Falsification: Provide a derivation (not parameter match) connecting
               fractional Laplacian alpha to physical d_s, or close.
```

If the boundary is not crossed within a defined timeframe, the claim is
closed as \"Closed/Toy\" or \"Speculative (obstructed)\".

## 5. Null Hypothesis Testing

All statistical claims require null hypothesis comparison:

1. **Generate null distribution** via permutation, bootstrap, or parametric model
2. **Compute test statistic** on observed data
3. **Report p-value** with correction for multiple comparisons (Bonferroni/Holm)
4. **Apply decision rule** consistently

Example: Zero-divisor eigenvalue mass matching (C-091) refuted because
null P(>=9/12 matches) = 1.0 (148 eigenvalues trivially cover 12 masses).

## 6. Trial Factor Ledger

For exploratory searches (e.g., TSCP sky alignment), maintain:

- Count of embedding choices tried
- Count of distance metrics evaluated
- Count of significance thresholds checked
- Global correction factor = product of trial counts

Report uncorrected AND corrected p-values.

## 7. Artifact Requirements

Every verified claim must have:

1. **Deterministic test** in `tests/test_*.py` or `crates/*/tests/`
2. **CSV artifact** in `data/csv/` (if quantitative)
3. **Source index** in `docs/external_sources/` (if literature-based)
4. **Provenance** for any external data (`.PROVENANCE.json`)

Tests must be:
- Offline (no network calls)
- Seeded (reproducible RNG)
- Fast (< 60s on CI)

## 8. Negative Result Policy

Negative results (Not supported, Refuted) are valuable:

1. **Document fully** in CLAIMS_EVIDENCE_MATRIX.md
2. **Keep test code** as regression guard
3. **Explain why** the claim failed
4. **Identify rescue conditions** if salvageable

Example: C-077 PMNS mixing refuted (Frobenius distance 0.611) but rescue
condition documented: \"needs symmetry-breaking mechanism + explicit null\".

## 9. Review Checklist

Before marking a claim Verified:

- [ ] Primary source cited with DOI/arXiv
- [ ] Test exists and passes
- [ ] Test is deterministic (seeded RNG)
- [ ] Test is offline (no network)
- [ ] Result matches literature (if applicable)
- [ ] Uncertainty quantified (if statistical)
- [ ] Last verified date updated (ISO format)
