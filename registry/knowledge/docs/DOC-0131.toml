# Phase 15: The \"Resurrection\" Report

**Date:** 2026-02-01
**Status:** Defect Resolution Complete

## 1. Analysis of Failure (v2)
The previous artifact `OCULUS_GRAND_DASHBOARD_v2.png` failed because:
*   **Warp Drive:** 10M rays on a 3000x3000 grid is sparse. The `atomicAdd` accumulation created single-pixel \"dust\" that was invisible without smoothing.
*   **Pareto:** The optimizer was generating random stacks that failed transmission checks ($B=0$), leading to a degenerate plot.
*   **Metasurface:** Plotting the *Real* part of the field showed low contrast standing waves.

## 2. Resolution Implementation (v3)
We deployed `grand_unified_simulator_v3.py` with the following fixes:
*   **Smoothing:** Applied `gaussian_filter(sigma=2.0)` to the Warp ray density map. This converts the sparse point cloud into a continuous probability density function (PDF), making the caustics glow visibly.
*   **Intensity:** Switched FDFD visualization to `log(1 + |E|^2)`. This reveals the high-contrast field confinement within the silicon pillars using the `magma` colormap.
*   **Optimization:** Upgraded `spaceplate_pareto_optimizer.py` to seed designs near the Quarter-Wave Stack (QWS) condition. This dramatically improved yield, populating the Pareto frontier with valid candidates.
*   **Aesthetics:** Used high-contrast colormaps (`winter`, `autumn`, `magma`) to ensure visibility against the black background.

## 3. The Artifact (v3)
`data/artifacts/images/OCULUS_GRAND_DASHBOARD_v3.png` now correctly displays:
*   **Warp Gate:** Bright, flowing optical caustics wrapping around the central bubble.
*   **Entropy Trap:** A clear red ring where rays are captured.
*   **Metasurface:** Distinct, high-intensity field hotspots inside the pillars.
*   **Pareto:** A populated frontier showing the trade-off between R and B.

This concludes the visualization debugging cycle.
