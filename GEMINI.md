# Gemini Overlay for open_gororoba

`AGENTS.md` is the canonical contributor contract.

This file is a lightweight overlay for Gemini-style workflows:

- Defer policy conflicts to `AGENTS.md`.
- Keep reproducible, deterministic, TOML-first edits.
- Validate with warnings-as-errors gates before completion.
- Keep cross-platform app surfaces inside `apps/`.
